I\\r\\nalso procured its eggs, and considerable information respecting its\\r\\nhabits and actions, which differ most remarkably from those of the true\\r\\n_Caprimulgidæ_, and on the other hand assimilate so closely to the\\r\\nsmaller Owls, particularly those comprised in the genus _Athene_, as to\\r\\nform as perfect an analogical representative of that group of birds as\\r\\ncan possibly be imagined, for which reason the English name of Owlet\\r\\nNightjar has been assigned to it.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the day it resorts to the hollow branches or spouts as they are\\r\\ncalled, and the holes of the gum-trees, sallying forth as night\\r\\napproaches in quest of insects, particularly the smaller _Coleoptera_,\\r\\nupon which it chiefly subsists. Its flight is straight, and not\\r\\ncharacterized by the sudden turns and descents of _Caprimulgus_. On\\r\\ndriving it from its haunts I have sometimes observed it to fly direct to\\r\\na similar hole in another tree, but more frequently to alight on a\\r\\nneighbouring branch, perching across and never parallel to it. When\\r\\nassailed in its retreat it emits a loud hissing noise, and has the same\\r\\nstooping motion of the head observable in the Owls; it also resembles\\r\\nthat tribe of birds in its erect carriage, the manner in which it sets\\r\\nout the feathers round the ears and neck, and in the power it possesses\\r\\nof turning the head in every direction, even over the back, a habit it\\r\\nis constantly practising. A pair I had for some time in captivity were\\r\\nfrequently leaping to the top of the cage, and had a singular mode of\\r\\nrunning or shuffling backwards to one corner of it.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile traversing the woods, the usual mode of ascertaining its presence\\r\\nis by tapping with a stone or a tomahawk at the base of the hollow\\r\\ntrees, when the little inmate, as represented in the upper figure of our\\r\\nPlate, will almost invariably ascend to the outlet and peep over to\\r\\nascertain the cause of disturbance. If the tree be lofty or its hole\\r\\ninaccessible, it will frequently retire again to its hiding-place, and\\r\\nthere remain until the annoyance be repeated, when it flies off to a\\r\\nplace of greater security. In these holes, without forming any nest, it\\r\\ndeposits its eggs, which are four or five in number, perfectly white,\\r\\nnearly round, and about one inch and a line in length and eleven lines\\r\\nin breadth. At least two broods are reared by each pair of birds during\\r\\nthe year. I have known the young to be taken in Van Diemen’s Land in\\r\\nOctober, and in New South Wales I have procured eggs in January.\\r\\n\\r\\nSpecimens from Van Diemen’s Land, Swan River, South Australia, and New\\r\\nSouth Wales, all present considerable difference in the colour and\\r\\nmarkings of the plumage, but none of sufficient importance to justify\\r\\ntheir separation into distinct species: in some the nuchal band and the\\r\\ncircular mark on the head are very conspicuous, while in others scarcely\\r\\na trace of these markings is observable; these variations do not depend\\r\\nupon habitat, but are constantly found in specimens from the same\\r\\nlocalities.\\r\\n\\r\\nLittle or no difference is apparent in the size or plumage of the sexes.\\r\\n\\r\\nAdults have the patches above the eyes, a semilunar mark at the back of\\r\\nthe head, a band round the neck, and all the under surface grey, finely\\r\\nsprinkled with black, and tinged with buff; ear-coverts reddish buff,\\r\\nthe remainder of the head blackish brown; all the upper surface and\\r\\nwings dark brown, sprinkled with grey in the form of irregular bars;\\r\\nprimaries brown, sprinkled on their outer webs with lighter brown and\\r\\ngrey; tail dark, regularly barred with numerous narrow lines of grey\\r\\nsprinkled with black: irides hazel; feet flesh colour.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn immature birds the lunulate markings are much richer in colour and\\r\\nmore distinct than in the adults, in many of which they are nearly\\r\\nobliterated, and the irides are nearly black.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe figures are of the natural size.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration:\\r\\n\\r\\n  ÆGOTHELES LEUCOGASTER: _Gould_.\\r\\n\\r\\n  _J.

Soc., June 25, 1844.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is altogether a larger and more powerful bird than the _Ægotheles\\r\\nNovæ-Hollandiæ_; besides which, the white colouring of the lower part of\\r\\nthe belly will at all times serve to distinguish it from that species.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is rather abundant on the Cobourg Peninsula, where it inhabits the\\r\\nforests in the immediate vicinity of Port Essington; how far its range\\r\\nmay extend is at present unknown, but it is probable that the bird is\\r\\ndistributed over the whole of the northern portion of the continent, and\\r\\nthat it there forms the representative of the _Æ. Novæ-Hollandiæ_, which\\r\\nup to the present time has only been found on the southern.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Gilbert states that it is abundant in most parts of the settlement\\r\\nat Port Essington, “where it is frequently seen flying about at\\r\\ntwilight, and occasionally during the day. On the approach of an\\r\\nintruder it flies very heavily from tree to tree, and on alighting\\r\\ninvariably turns round on the branch to watch his approach, moving the\\r\\nhead all the time after the manner of the Hawk tribe.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sexes when fully adult will not I expect be found to differ in\\r\\nplumage. I attribute the redness of some of my specimens to the age of\\r\\nthe individuals; but whether the red varieties or the grey are the most\\r\\nmature birds, I have not had sufficient opportunities of ascertaining.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt feeds on insects of all kinds, and as the bird is strictly nocturnal\\r\\nin its habits, they are, as a matter of course, procured at night.\\r\\n\\r\\nHead black; the crown, a lunar-shaped mark at the back of the head, and\\r\\na collar surrounding the back of the neck freckled with grey; back\\r\\nfreckled black and white; wings brown, crossed by numerous bands of\\r\\nlighter brown freckled with dark brown; primaries margined externally\\r\\nwith buff, interrupted with blotchings of dark brown; tail dark brown,\\r\\ncrossed by numerous broad irregular bands of reddish buff freckled with\\r\\ndark brown; ear-coverts straw-white; chin, abdomen and under\\r\\ntail-coverts white; breast and sides of the neck white, crossed by\\r\\nnumerous freckled bars of black; irides dark brown; upper mandible dark\\r\\nolive-brown, lower mandible white with a black tip; legs very pale\\r\\nyellow; claws black.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe figures are of the natural size.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration:\\r\\n\\r\\n  PODARGUS HUMERALIS: _Vig. & Horsf._\\r\\n\\r\\n  _J. & E.

But as it must ever remain a matter of\\r\\nuncertainty as to which these names have been applied, I have preferred\\r\\nto retain for the present bird that proposed by Messrs. Vigors and\\r\\nHorsfield.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Tawny-shouldered Podargus may be distinguished by the greater\\r\\nbreadth of its markings, by the decided admixture of tawny in its\\r\\ncolouring, by the feathers of the head having a small round spot of\\r\\nwhite at the tip, and by the more boldly-marked tips of the coverts. It\\r\\nis plentifully dispersed over New South Wales, where it is not\\r\\nrestricted to any peculiar character of country, but inhabits alike the\\r\\nthick brushes near the coast, the hilly districts, and the thinly-wooded\\r\\nplains of the interior. I found it breeding on the low swampy islands\\r\\nstudding the mouth of the Hunter, and on the Apple-tree (_Angophora_)\\r\\nflats of Yarrundi, near the Liverpool Range. In their habits and mode of\\r\\nlife the _Podargi_ differ very considerably from the true Nightjars, and\\r\\nalso in many particulars from _Ægotheles_.\\r\\n\\r\\nLike the rest of the genus, the Tawny-shouldered Podargus is strictly\\r\\nnocturnal, sleeping throughout the day on the dead branch of a tree, in\\r\\nan upright position across, and never parallel to, the branch, and which\\r\\nit so nearly resembles as scarcely to be distinguishable from it. I have\\r\\noccasionally seen it beneath the thick foliage of the _Casuarinæ_, and I\\r\\nhave been informed that it sometimes shelters itself in the hollow\\r\\ntrunks of the _Eucalypti_, but I could never detect one in such a\\r\\nsituation; I mostly found them in pairs, perched near each other on the\\r\\nbranches of the gums, in situations not at all sheltered from the beams\\r\\nof the midday sun. So lethargic are its slumbers, that it is almost\\r\\nimpossible to arouse it, and I have frequently shot one without\\r\\ndisturbing its mate sitting close by; it may also be knocked off with\\r\\nsticks or stones, and sometimes is even taken with the hand: when\\r\\naroused, it flies lazily off with heavy flapping wings to a neighbouring\\r\\ntree, and again resumes its slumbers until the approach of evening, when\\r\\nit becomes as animated and active as it had been previously dull and\\r\\nstupid. The food consists of insects of various kinds; but in what way\\r\\nthey are obtained is uncertain, though the contents of the stomach of\\r\\none I dissected induce me to believe that it does not usually capture\\r\\nits prey while on the wing, or subsist upon nocturnal insects alone, but\\r\\nthat it is in the habit of creeping among the branches in search of such\\r\\nas are in a state of repose; and an examination of the tail will, I\\r\\nthink, serve to strengthen this supposition, since it in some degree\\r\\nresembles the form and structure of that organ in many of the climbing\\r\\nbirds. The power it possesses of shifting the position of the outer toe\\r\\nbackwards, as circumstances may require, is a very singular feature, and\\r\\nmay also tend to assist them in their progress among the branches. A\\r\\nbird I shot at Yarrundi, in the middle of the night, had the stomach\\r\\nfilled with fresh-captured mantis and locusts (_Phasmidæ_ and _Cicadæ_),\\r\\nwhich never move at night, and the latter of which are generally resting\\r\\nagainst the upright boles of the trees. In other specimens I found the\\r\\nremains of small _Coleoptera_, intermingled with the fibres of the roots\\r\\nof what appeared to be a parasitic plant, such as would be found in\\r\\ndecayed and hollow trees. The whole contour of the bird shows that it is\\r\\nnot formed for extensive flight or for performing those rapid evolutions\\r\\nthat are necessary for the capture of its prey in the air, the wing\\r\\nbeing short and concave in comparison with those of the true aërial\\r\\nNightjars, and particularly with the Australian form to which I have\\r\\ngiven the name of _Eurostopodus_.\\r\\n\\r\\nOf its mode of nidification I can speak with confidence, having seen\\r\\nmany pairs breeding during my rambles in the woods. It makes a\\r\\nslightly-constructed flat nest of sticks carelessly interwoven together,\\r\\nand placed at the fork of a horizontal branch of sufficient size to\\r\\nensure its safety; the tree most frequently chosen is an _Eucalyptus_,\\r\\nbut I have occasionally seen the nest on an Apple-tree (_Angophora_) or\\r\\na Swamp-Oak (_Casuarina_). In every instance one of the birds was\\r\\nsitting on the eggs and the other perched on a neighbouring bough, both\\r\\ninvariably asleep; that the male participates in the duty of incubation\\r\\nI ascertained by having accidentally shot a bird on the nest without\\r\\nbeing aware it was so occupied, which on dissection proved to be a male.\\r\\nThe eggs are generally two in number, of a beautiful immaculate white,\\r\\nand of a long oval form, one inch and ten lines in length by one inch\\r\\nand three lines in diameter.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sexes so closely resemble each other both in size and plumage, that\\r\\na separate description is unnecessary. Like the other species of the\\r\\ngenus, it is subject to considerable variation in its colouring; the\\r\\nyoung, which assume the adult livery at an early age, being somewhat\\r\\ndarker in all their markings.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe night-call of this species is a loud hoarse noise, consisting of two\\r\\ndistinct sounds, which cannot be correctly described.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe stomach is thick and muscular, and is lined with a thick hair-like\\r\\nsubstance like that of the Common Cuckoo.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll the upper surface brown, speckled with greyish white and darker\\r\\nbrown, the feathers of the crown having a blackish brown stripe down the\\r\\ncentre terminating in a minute spot of white; wings similar to the upper\\r\\nsurface, but lighter and with bolder black and buff spots, the coverts\\r\\nhaving an irregular spot of white and tawny on the outer web near the\\r\\ntip, which, as they lie over each other, form indistinct bands across\\r\\nthe wing; primaries brownish black, with light-coloured shafts, and with\\r\\na series of whitish spots on the outer webs, between which they are\\r\\nmargined with tawny; their inner webs irregularly barred with the same;\\r\\ntail tawny brown, sprinkled with lighter brown, and crossed with a\\r\\nseries of irregular bands of blackish brown, sprinkled with dusky white,\\r\\neach feather having a spot of brownish black near the extremity, and\\r\\ntipped with white; face and all the under surface greyish white, crossed\\r\\nby numerous narrow and irregular bars of tawny, and with a stripe of\\r\\nbrown down the centre of each feather, the latter colour being most\\r\\nconspicuous and forming a kind of semilunar mark down each side of the\\r\\nchest; bill light brown, tinged with purple; inside of the mouth pale\\r\\nyellow; tongue long, transparent, and of the same colour with the inside\\r\\nof the mouth; irides brownish orange; feet light brownish olive.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn some the rich tawny colour predominates, while others are more grey.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe bird is represented of the natural size, asleep, in the position it\\r\\nis usually seen during the day.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration:\\r\\n\\r\\n  PODARGUS CUVIERI: _Vig. and Horsf._\\r\\n\\r\\n  _J.

Trans., vol. xv. p. 200.\\r\\n\\r\\n  _More-pork_ of the Colonists.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThis species is readily distinguished from the _Podargus humeralis_ by\\r\\nthe bill being much less robust and of a more adpressed form, while the\\r\\nculmen is sharp and elevated; the bird itself is also of a smaller size\\r\\nand altogether more slender than its near ally. Van Diemen’s Land, if\\r\\nnot its exclusive habitat, is certainly its great stronghold, it being\\r\\nthere very numerous, as evidenced by the frequency with which I\\r\\nencountered it during my rambles in the woods; and its distribution over\\r\\nthe island is so general, that to particularize localities in which it\\r\\nmay be found is quite unnecessary, it being equally abundant near the\\r\\ncoast as well as in the interior. I observed it both among the thick\\r\\nbranches of the _Casuarinæ_ and on the dead limbs of the _Eucalypti_; it\\r\\nappeared however to evince a greater partiality for the latter, which it\\r\\nclosely resembles in colour, and from the position in which it rests,\\r\\nlooks so like a part of the branch itself as frequently to elude\\r\\ndetection; it is generally seen in pairs sitting near each other, and\\r\\nfrequently on the same branch. Like the other members of the genus, this\\r\\nbird feeds almost exclusively on insects, of which Coleoptera form a\\r\\ngreat part: it is strictly nocturnal in its habits, and although not so\\r\\nactive as the true _Caprimulgi_, displays considerable alertness in the\\r\\ncapture of its food, presenting a striking contrast to its inertness in\\r\\nthe daytime, when it is so drowsy that it can scarcely be aroused from\\r\\nits slumbers; that portion of its existence being passed in a sitting\\r\\nposture across a dead branch, perfectly motionless and with the bill\\r\\npointing upwards: it never flies by day unless roused from the branch on\\r\\nwhich it is sitting, and this is not easily effected, as neither the\\r\\ndischarge of a gun nor any other noise will cause it to take wing. It is\\r\\nfrequently captured and kept in captivity, where it excites attention\\r\\nmore from the sluggishness of its nature and the singular position it\\r\\nassumes than from any other cause: raw meat forms a suitable substitute\\r\\nfor its natural food. In captivity it will pass the entire day in sleep\\r\\non the back of a chair or any other piece of furniture on which it can\\r\\nperch. Like the owl, it is considered by some a bird of ill omen,\\r\\nprincipally from the extraordinary sound of its hoarse, unearthly cry,\\r\\nwhich resembles the words _more-pork_; it not only approaches the\\r\\nimmediate vicinity of the houses, but emits this sound while perched in\\r\\ntheir verandahs and on the buildings themselves; and it is often to be\\r\\nseen perched on the tombstones of the churchyard.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt builds a somewhat neatly-formed flat nest, about seven inches in\\r\\ndiameter, in the fork of an horizontal branch; the exterior formed of\\r\\nsmall sticks, and the interior of the fibrous portions of various\\r\\nplants; the eggs are white, and nearly of a true oval in form, being one\\r\\ninch and nine lines long by one inch and three lines broad.\\r\\n\\r\\nConsiderable variation occurs in the colouring of individuals, the\\r\\nprevailing tint being a dull ashy grey, while others are of a rich\\r\\nchestnut hue; but whether this be indicative of immaturity, or\\r\\ncharacteristic of the fully adult plumage, I have not been able to\\r\\nsatisfy myself.

Like the members of the genus inhabiting Van\\r\\nDiemen’s Land and New South Wales, it exhibits considerable variation in\\r\\nsize and colouring; in some a rusty red tint pervades the whole plumage,\\r\\nwhile in others no trace of this hue occurs. I am inclined to consider\\r\\nthat age has much to do with this variation in colour: but whether the\\r\\nred-tinted birds are immature or adult I have had no means of\\r\\nascertaining; further observation is necessary to determine this point;\\r\\nand I consequently hope the subject will not be neglected by those who\\r\\nmay have an opportunity of observing the bird alive: the red-tinted\\r\\nbirds occur less frequently than the others.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have several specimens from the north-west coast of Australia, and Mr.\\r\\nGilbert states that it is abundant in every part of the Cobourg\\r\\nPeninsula.\\r\\n\\r\\nLike the rest of the genus it is strictly nocturnal in its habits;\\r\\nbecoming animated at the approach of evening, it sallies forth from the\\r\\nfavourite branch where it has rested during the day in search of\\r\\ninsects, which, I believe, constitute almost exclusively its food; its\\r\\nwhole economy in fact, so far as known, so closely resembles that of the\\r\\n_Podargus humeralis_, that one description would serve for both.\\r\\n\\r\\nForehead, sides of the face and all the under surface brownish grey,\\r\\nminutely freckled with black; the feathers of the under surface with a\\r\\nstripe of blackish brown down the centre, these stripes being broadest\\r\\nand most conspicuous on the sides of the chest; all the upper surface\\r\\nbrown, minutely freckled with grey, each feather with a broad stripe of\\r\\nblack down the centre; shoulders dark brown; coverts freckled with\\r\\ngreyish white and with a spot of white, the centre of which is\\r\\nfawn-colour at the tip; primaries dark brown, crossed on their outer\\r\\nwebs with an irregular bar of white, the interspaces on the outer\\r\\nprimaries rufous; inner webs of the primaries crossed by irregular bands\\r\\nof freckled brown and fawn-colour; tail brown, crossed by numerous broad\\r\\nbands of freckled grey, bounded on either side by irregular blotchings\\r\\nof black; irides orange or reddish hazel; bill horn-colour.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the other state, to which I have alluded, the whole of the upper\\r\\nsurface is of a dark rust-red, freckled on the forehead, wing-coverts\\r\\nand scapularies with white; the bands on the tail less apparent; a\\r\\nrufous tint pervades the grey of the under surface, and the striæ are\\r\\nmuch narrower than in the specimen above described.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Plate represents a male and a female, in the differently tinted\\r\\nplumage, of the natural size.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration:\\r\\n\\r\\n  PODARGUS PLUMIFERUS: _Gould_.\\r\\n\\r\\n  _J.

It is\\r\\nreadily distinguished from all the other Australian members of the genus\\r\\nby the more lengthened form of tail, and by the remarkable and\\r\\nconspicuous tufts of feathers which spring from immediately above the\\r\\nnostrils: considerable variation is found to exist in the colouring of\\r\\nthe various specimens, some being much redder than the others, and\\r\\nhaving the markings on the under surface much less distinct and of a\\r\\nmore chestnut tint.\\r\\n\\r\\nNothing whatever is known of its habits and economy, points which must\\r\\nremain for future discovery and research to make known.\\r\\n\\r\\nTuft of feathers covering the nostrils alternately banded with blackish\\r\\nbrown and white; all the upper surface mottled brown, black, and\\r\\nbrownish white, the latter predominating over each eye, where it forms a\\r\\nconspicuous patch; the markings are of a larger but similar kind on the\\r\\nwings, and on the primaries and secondaries assume the form of bars;\\r\\ntail similar but paler, and with the barred form of the markings still\\r\\nmore distinct; centre of the throat and chest brownish white, minutely\\r\\nfreckled with brown; sides of the neck and breast, and all the under\\r\\nsurface similar, but with a dark line of brown down the centre, and two\\r\\nlarge nearly square-shaped spots of brownish white near the tip of each\\r\\nfeather; bill and feet horn-colour.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe figures are of the natural size.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration:\\r\\n\\r\\n  EUROSTOPODUS ALBOGULARIS.\\r\\n\\r\\n  _J.

Col. 410.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring my visit to Australia I had opportunities of observing a number\\r\\nof this species; it is still, however, a rare bird in all our\\r\\ncollections, and how far it may range over the Australian continent is\\r\\nnot known; the south-eastern are the only portions in which it has yet\\r\\nbeen discovered; and although all the specimens I have seen in\\r\\ncollections were procured at Moreton Bay, I have killed three or four of\\r\\nan evening on the cleared lands on the Upper Hunter, which shows that it\\r\\nis far from being a scarce bird in that part of New South Wales. In all\\r\\nprobability it is only a summer visitant in the colony, as it was at\\r\\nthis season only that I observed it. In the daytime it sleeps on the\\r\\nground on some dry knoll or open part of the forest, and as twilight\\r\\napproaches sallies forth to the open glades and small plains or cleared\\r\\nlands in search of insects; its flight, which is much more powerful than\\r\\nthat of any other Goatsucker I have seen, enabling it to pass through\\r\\nthe air with great rapidity, and to mount up and dart down almost at\\r\\nright angles whenever an insect comes within the range of its eye, which\\r\\nis so large and full that its powers of vision must be very great. Most\\r\\nof those I shot were gorged with insects, principally coleoptera and\\r\\nlocusts, some of which were entire and so large as to excite surprise\\r\\nhow they could be swallowed; in several instances they were so perfect,\\r\\nthat I preserved them as specimens for my entomological collection.\\r\\n\\r\\nOf its nidification I have no information to furnish; it doubtless,\\r\\nhowever, breeds on the ground, and judging from analogy its eggs will be\\r\\nfound to be either one or two in number, and in form and colour\\r\\npartaking of the character of those of _Caprimulgus_, and not of those\\r\\nof _Podargus_ and _Ægotheles_.\\r\\n\\r\\nContrary to what might have been expected, I found that although the\\r\\nsexes are nearly alike in colour, the females always exceed the males in\\r\\nsize and in the brilliance of the tints; the males, on the other hand,\\r\\nhave the two white spots on the third and fourth primaries more\\r\\nconspicuous than in the female.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll the upper surface very minutely freckled grey and brown; the\\r\\nfeathers on the crown of the head and at the occiput with a large patch\\r\\nof black down the centre; behind the ear-coverts a patch of dark brown\\r\\nsprinkled with brownish buff; from the angle of the mouth passing round\\r\\nthe back of the neck an indistinct collar of intermingled buff, chestnut\\r\\nand black; scapularies variegated with dark brown on their outer webs\\r\\nand margined with bright fulvous; wing dark brown variegated with\\r\\nfulvous and grey; secondaries dark brown, with a regular series of\\r\\nbright fulvous spots along each web; primaries blackish brown, the two\\r\\nfirst without any spot, the remainder spotted like the secondaries, the\\r\\nthird having a spot of white on its inner and outer web about the centre\\r\\nof the feather, the fourth with a large white spot on its outer web; two\\r\\ncentre and outer webs of the remaining tail-feathers dark brown, marbled\\r\\nwith irregular bars of grey; the inner webs of the lateral feathers dark\\r\\nbrown, crossed with irregular bands of light buff; throat blackish\\r\\nbrown, spotted with bright buff; on each side of the throat a large oval\\r\\nspot of white; breast dark brown, spotted above with dull buff, and\\r\\nbroadly freckled with dull buff and grey; abdomen and under tail-coverts\\r\\nbright fulvous, crossed with bars of dark brown; irides dark brown; feet\\r\\nmealy reddish brown.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Plate represents a female of the natural size.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration:\\r\\n\\r\\n  EUROSTOPODUS GUTTATUS.\\r\\n\\r\\n  _J.

I\\r\\nkilled it in South Australia and in New South Wales; the collection\\r\\nformed by Mr. Gilbert at Swan River also contained specimens which\\r\\npresented no difference whatever, either in size or markings.\\r\\n\\r\\nI more than once flushed this bird in open day, when, after mounting\\r\\nrapidly in the air, it performed a few zigzag evolutions and pitched\\r\\nagain to the earth at a distant spot. That it breeds on the ground there\\r\\ncan be no doubt, as I found a newly-hatched young one on the precise\\r\\nspot from which I had flushed the adult; the little helpless creature,\\r\\nwhich much resembled a small mass of down or wool, was of a reddish\\r\\nbrown colour, not very dissimilar from the surface of the ground where\\r\\nit had been hatched: my utmost endeavours to find the broken shell were\\r\\nentirely unavailing; I am consequently unable to describe the egg, or to\\r\\nfurnish any further information respecting the nidification of this\\r\\nsingular form.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sexes are so nearly alike in colour and size that they are not to be\\r\\ndistinguished except by dissection; the young, on the contrary, is\\r\\nclothed in a more buffy brown dress until it has attained the size of\\r\\nthe adult.\\r\\n\\r\\nForehead and centre of the head brownish black, each feather spotted and\\r\\nmargined with bright buff; over each eye the feathers are pearly white\\r\\nvery finely pencilled with brownish black; lores and sides of the face\\r\\nbrown spotted with buff; collar at the back of the head reddish\\r\\nchestnut; back grey freckled with black; scapularies light grey freckled\\r\\nwith brownish black, largely tipped with bright buff, with an irregular\\r\\ndiagonal patch of black; wing-coverts grey, spotted and freckled with\\r\\nbrown, each feather largely tipped with bright buff; primaries and\\r\\nsecondaries brownish black, marked on both webs with buff, the buff on\\r\\nthe outer webs being in the form of round spots, on the inner webs\\r\\nirregular bars; on the inner web of the first primary is a large spot of\\r\\npure white, on the second primaries a similar but larger spot, and a\\r\\nsmall one on the outer web; the third and fourth crossed by a large\\r\\nirregular patch of white; middle tail-feathers light grey, marbled and\\r\\nfinely freckled with dark brown; lateral feathers light grey barred with\\r\\nblackish brown and bright buff, and freckled with dark brown, the buff\\r\\non the outer web of the outside feather forming a regular row of spots;\\r\\non each side of the throat an oblique line of white; chest dark brown,\\r\\neach feather broadly barred and spotted with light buff; abdomen bright\\r\\nbuff, finely and irregularly barred with black; under tail-coverts\\r\\nsandy; bill black; irides very dark brown; feet mealy reddish brown.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Plate represents an adult male and a young bird of the natural size.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration:\\r\\n\\r\\n  CAPRIMULGUS MACRURUS: _Horsf._\\r\\n\\r\\n  _J.

It inhabits the\\r\\nopen parts of the forest and is strictly nocturnal; it mostly rests on\\r\\nthe ground on the shady side of a large tree close to the roots, and if\\r\\ndisturbed several times in succession takes to the branch of one of the\\r\\nlargest trees. I have never seen the eggs of this species, but I possess\\r\\na young bird apparently only a few days old, which Mr. Gilbert found\\r\\nlying under a shrubby tree, without any nest or even a blade of grass\\r\\nnear it; the little creature was so similar in colour to that of the\\r\\nground upon which it was lying, that it was with difficulty detected,\\r\\nand Mr. Gilbert was only induced to search for it from the very peculiar\\r\\nmanner in which the old bird rose, the reluctance it evinced to leave\\r\\nthe spot, and its hovering over the place it had risen from, instead of\\r\\nflying off to the distance of nearly a hundred yards, as it usually\\r\\ndoes.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sexes are distinguished from each other by the greater extent of the\\r\\nwhite mark on the primaries and outer tail-feathers; in other parts of\\r\\nthe plumage and in size there is no difference.\\r\\n\\r\\nIts food consists of moths, flies and coleopterous insects, which are\\r\\ntaken during flight.\\r\\n\\r\\nHead brownish grey, very minutely freckled with black; the feathers down\\r\\nthe middle of the head and occiput with a large broad stripe of black\\r\\ndown the centre; lores, space surrounding the eyes and ear-coverts\\r\\nreddish brown; on each side of the neck a broad stripe of rich buff\\r\\nbarred with black; a narrow line of white passes below the angle of the\\r\\nmouth; chin brown; across the throat a band of white bounded below by\\r\\nblack, the extremities of the white feathers being of that hue; centre\\r\\nof the back dark brown, freckled with black and buff; shoulders blackish\\r\\nbrown; wing-coverts freckled grey, buff and black, each with a large\\r\\nspot of buff at the tip; primaries and secondaries blackish brown, the\\r\\nformer crossed at their base, and the latter throughout their entire\\r\\nlength, with reddish buff; the second and third primaries crossed near\\r\\ntheir base with a broad band of white, stained with buff on the outer\\r\\nmargin; the first primary with a spot of white only on the margin of the\\r\\ninner web; the first three primaries freckled at their tips, and the\\r\\nremainder for the entire length of their inner webs with brownish grey;\\r\\nscapularies freckled grey and brown, with a large patch of deep dull\\r\\nblack on their outer webs, margined externally with buff; rump freckled\\r\\nwith dark brown and grey, and with an interrupted line of darker brown\\r\\ndown the centre of each feather; two centre tail-feathers minutely and\\r\\ncoarsely freckled with very dark brown; the next on each side very dark\\r\\nbrown, crossed by irregular bands of freckled brownish grey and black;\\r\\nthe next on each side similar, but the bands narrower and less\\r\\nconspicuous; the two outer ones on each side very dark brown for three\\r\\nparts of the length, the apical portion being white, stained with\\r\\nfreckled buff and black on the outer webs; the basal or dark portion\\r\\ncrossed by narrow indistinct and irregular bars of deep buff; breast\\r\\nfreckled buff, grey and brown, some of the feathers in the centre of the\\r\\nbreast largely tipped with buff; abdomen and under tail-coverts deep\\r\\nbuff, crossed by narrow regular bands of dark brown; irides blackish\\r\\nbrown; bill black; feet and claws reddish brown.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Plate represents a male and a female of the natural size.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration:\\r\\n\\r\\n  ACANTHYLIS CAUDACUTA.\\r\\n\\r\\n  _J.

The months of January and February are those in\\r\\nwhich it has been most frequently observed in Van Diemen’s Land, where\\r\\nit simultaneously appears in large flocks, which after spending a few\\r\\ndays disappear as suddenly as they arrived. I am not aware of its having\\r\\nbeen observed in Western Australia, neither has it occurred in any of\\r\\nthe collections formed at Port Essington.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe keel or breast-bone of this species is more than ordinarily deep,\\r\\nand the pectoral muscles more developed than in any other bird of its\\r\\nweight with which I am acquainted. Its whole form is especially and\\r\\nbeautifully adapted for aërial progression, and as its lengthened wings\\r\\nwould lead us to imagine, its power of flight, both for rapidity and\\r\\nextension, is truly amazing; hence it readily passes from one part of\\r\\nthe country to another, and if so disposed may be engaged in hawking for\\r\\nflies on the continent of Australia at one moment, and in half an hour\\r\\nbe similarly employed in Van Diemen’s Land.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo exclusively is this bird a tenant of the air, that I never in any\\r\\ninstance saw it perch, and but rarely sufficiently near the earth to\\r\\nadmit of a successful shot; it is only late in the evening and during\\r\\nlowery weather that such an object can be accomplished. With the\\r\\nexception of the Crane, it is certainly the most lofty as well as the\\r\\nmost vigorous flier of the Australian birds. I have frequently observed\\r\\nin the middle of the hottest days, while lying prostrate on the ground\\r\\nwith my eyes directed upwards, the cloudless blue sky peopled at an\\r\\nimmense elevation by hundreds of these birds, performing extensive\\r\\ncurves and sweeping flights, doubtless attracted thither by the insects\\r\\nthat soar aloft during serene weather; hence, as I have before stated,\\r\\nfew birds are more difficult to obtain, particularly on the continent of\\r\\nAustralia, where long droughts are so prevalent; on the contrary, the\\r\\nflocks that visit the more humid climate of Van Diemen’s Land, where\\r\\nthey necessarily seek their food near the earth, are often greatly\\r\\ndiminished by the gun during their stay.\\r\\n\\r\\nI regret that I could ascertain no particulars whatever respecting the\\r\\nnidification of this fine bird, but we may naturally conclude that both\\r\\nrocks and holes in the larger trees are selected as sites for the\\r\\npurpose, as well as for a roosting-place during the night. Before\\r\\nretiring to roost, which it does immediately after the sun has gone\\r\\ndown, the Spine-tailed Swallow may frequently be seen, either singly or\\r\\nin pairs, sweeping up the gullies or flying with immense rapidity just\\r\\nabove the tops of the trees, their never-tiring wings enabling them to\\r\\nperform their evolutions in the capture of insects, and of sustaining\\r\\nthemselves in the air during the entire day, without cessation.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sexes offer no perceptible difference in their outward appearance;\\r\\nbut the female, as is the case with the other members of the family, is\\r\\na trifle smaller than her mate.\\r\\n\\r\\nCrown of the head, back of the neck, and ear-coverts deep shining green\\r\\nstrongly tinged with brown; a small space immediately before the eye\\r\\ndeep velvety black; band across the forehead, throat, inner webs of the\\r\\nsecondaries nearest the back, a patch on the lower part of the flanks\\r\\nand the under tail-coverts white; wings and tail deep shining green,\\r\\nwith purple reflexions; centre of the back greyish brown, becoming\\r\\ndarker towards the rump; chest and abdomen dark clove-brown; bill black;\\r\\nfeet brown.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe figures are those of the male and female of the natural size.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration:\\r\\n\\r\\n  CYPSELUS AUSTRALIS: _Gould_.\\r\\n\\r\\n  _J.

Those I then observed were flying high in the air and performing\\r\\nimmense sweeps and circles, while engaged in the capture of insects. I\\r\\nsucceeded in killing six or eight individuals, among which were adult\\r\\nexamples of both sexes, but I was unable to obtain any particulars as to\\r\\ntheir habits and economy. It would be highly interesting to know whether\\r\\nthis bird, like the other members of the family, returns annually to\\r\\nspend the months of summer in Australia. I think it likely that this may\\r\\nbe the case, and that it may have been frequently confounded with the\\r\\n_Acanthylis caudacuta_, as I have more than once seen the two species\\r\\nunited in flocks, hawking together in the cloudless skies, like the\\r\\nMartins and Swallows of our own island. By the discovery of this bird\\r\\nanother beautiful instance of representation is brought under our\\r\\nnotice; evincing most clearly that the Australian Swift, Swallow and\\r\\nMartin are representatives of the Swift, Swallow and Martin of Europe,\\r\\neach performing in their respective hemispheres similar offices in the\\r\\ngreat scheme of nature.\\r\\n\\r\\nThroat and rump white; upper and under surface of the body brown; the\\r\\nback tinged with a bronzy metallic lustre; each feather of the under\\r\\nsurface margined with white; wings and tail dark brown; irides, bill and\\r\\nfeet black.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe figures are those of a male and a female of the natural size.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration:\\r\\n\\r\\n  ATTICORA LEUCOSTERNON: _Gould_.\\r\\n\\r\\n  _J.

It is a very\\r\\nwandering species, never very numerous, and is generally seen in small\\r\\nflocks of from ten to twenty in number, flying about, sometimes in\\r\\ncompany with the other Swallows, for about ten minutes, and then flying\\r\\nright away; I noticed this singular habit every time I had an\\r\\nopportunity of observing the species. It usually flies very high, a\\r\\ncircumstance which renders it difficult to procure specimens.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Its flight more nearly resembles that of the Swift than that of the\\r\\nSwallow; its cry also, at times, very much resembles that of the former.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Its food principally consists of minute black flies.\\r\\n\\r\\n“This bird chooses for its nest the deserted hole of either the Dalgyte\\r\\n(_Perameles lagotis_) or the Boodee (a species of _Bettongia_), in the\\r\\nside of which it burrows for about seven or nine inches in a horizontal\\r\\ndirection, making no nest, but merely laying its eggs on the bare sand.”\\r\\n\\r\\nCrown of the head light brown, surrounded by a ring of white; lores\\r\\nblack; a broad band commencing at the eye, and passing round the back of\\r\\nthe neck, brown; centre of the back, throat, chest and under surface of\\r\\nthe shoulder white; wings and tail brownish black; rump, upper\\r\\ntail-coverts, abdomen and under tail-coverts black; irides dark reddish\\r\\nbrown; bill blackish brown; legs and feet greenish grey.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe figures are of the natural size.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration:\\r\\n\\r\\n  HIRUNDO NEOXENA: _Gould_.\\r\\n\\r\\n  _J.

Messrs.\\r\\nVigors and Horsfield, in their “List of Australian Birds,” published in\\r\\nthe fifteenth volume of the Linnean Transactions, state that they “have\\r\\nbeen led into a more detailed description of this species, in order to\\r\\npoint out the differences of its characters from those of our European\\r\\nspecies _Hir. rustica_, with which it has been generally confounded;”\\r\\nbut while they have very clearly pointed out the distinctive characters\\r\\nof the two species, they have, in my opinion, departed from their usual\\r\\naccuracy in considering it to be identical with the bird figured by\\r\\nSparmann in the “Museum Carlsonianum” under the name of _Hirundo\\r\\nJavanica_, which is there represented with a square tail, and which, if\\r\\ndrawn correctly, is not only specifically but generically distinct. I\\r\\nhave also compared specimens of the Australian Swallow with the\\r\\n_Hirondelle Orientale_ of M. Temminck’s “Planches Coloriées,” with which\\r\\nspecies it was likewise considered to be identical by Messrs. Vigors and\\r\\nHorsfield, but from which also I conceive it to be distinct. On the\\r\\ncontrary, the Swallow figured in Griffith’s edition of Cuvier’s “Animal\\r\\nKingdom” is certainly the Australian bird; but as the specific term\\r\\nthere given had been previously employed by Sparmann, as mentioned\\r\\nabove, the necessity of a new name for the present species has been\\r\\nforced upon me; and that of _neoxena_ has suggested itself as\\r\\nappropriate, from the circumstance of its appearance throughout the\\r\\nwhole of the southern portions of Australia being hailed as a welcome\\r\\nindication of the approach of spring, and its arrival there associated\\r\\nwith precisely the same ideas as those popularly entertained respecting\\r\\nour own pretty Swallow in Europe. The two species are in fact beautiful\\r\\nrepresentatives of each other, and assimilate not only in their\\r\\nmigratory movements, but also most closely in their whole habits,\\r\\nactions and economy. It arrives in Van Diemen’s Land about the middle or\\r\\nend of September, and after rearing at least two broods departs again\\r\\nnorthwards in March; but it is evident that the migratory movement of\\r\\nthe Swallow, and doubtless that of all other birds, is regulated\\r\\nentirely by the temperature and the more or less abundant supply of food\\r\\nnecessary for its existence; for I found that in New South Wales, and\\r\\nevery country in Australia within the same latitude, it arrived much\\r\\nearlier and departed considerably later than in Van Diemen’s Land; and\\r\\nMr. Caley, who resided in New South Wales for several years, and whose\\r\\nvaluable notes on the birds of that part of the country have been so\\r\\noften quoted, states that “the earliest period of the year that I\\r\\nnoticed the appearance of _Swallows_ was on the 12th of July 1803, when\\r\\nI saw two; but I remarked several towards the end of the same month in\\r\\nthe following year (1804). The latest period I observed them was on the\\r\\n30th of May 1806, when a number of them were twittering and flying high\\r\\nin the air. When I missed them at Paramatta, I have sometimes met with\\r\\nthem among the north rocks, a romantic spot about two miles to the\\r\\nnorthward of the former place.” A few stragglers remain in New South\\r\\nWales during the whole of the winter, but their numbers cannot be for a\\r\\nmoment compared with those to be observed in the summer, and which\\r\\nduring the colder months have wended their way to a warmer and more\\r\\ncongenial climate, where insect life is sufficiently abundant for the\\r\\nsupport of so great a multitude. I have never been able to trace this\\r\\nbird very far to the north; it certainly does not visit Java, nor I\\r\\nbelieve New Guinea, neither have I yet seen it from Port Essington or\\r\\nany part of the north coast, although it is probable that its range does\\r\\nextend thus far.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe natural breeding-places of this bird are the deep clefts of rocks\\r\\nand dark caverns, but since the colonization of Australia it has in a\\r\\nremarkable degree imitated its European prototype, by selecting for the\\r\\nsite of its nest, the smoky chimneys, the chambers of mills and\\r\\nout-houses, or the corner of a shady verandah; the nest is also\\r\\nsimilarly constructed, being open at the top, formed of mud or clay,\\r\\nintermingled with grass or straw to bind it firmly together, and lined\\r\\nfirst with a layer of fine grasses and then with feathers. The shape of\\r\\nthe nest depends upon the situation in which it is built, but it\\r\\ngenerally assumes a rounded form in front. The eggs are usually four in\\r\\nnumber, of a lengthened form; the ground colour pinky white, with\\r\\nnumerous fine spots of purplish brown, the interspaces with specks of\\r\\nlight greyish brown, assuming in some instances the form of a zone at\\r\\nthe larger end; they are from eight to nine lines long by six lines\\r\\nbroad. At Swan River the breeding-season is in September and October.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe food consists of small flies and other insects.\\r\\n\\r\\nForehead, chin, throat and chest rust-red; head, back of the neck, back,\\r\\nscapularies, wing-coverts, rump and upper tail-coverts deep steel-blue;\\r\\nwings and tail blackish brown, all but the two centre feathers of the\\r\\nlatter with an oblique mark of white on the inner web; under surface\\r\\nvery pale brown; under tail-coverts pale brown passing into an irregular\\r\\ncrescent-shaped mark near the extremity and tipped with white; irides\\r\\ndark brown; bill and legs black.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe figures are those of a male and female of the natural size.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration:\\r\\n\\r\\n  CHELIDON ARBOREA: _Gould_.\\r\\n\\r\\n  _J.

Vigors and Horsfield in the Linnean Transactions, as\\r\\nquoted above, I have been necessitated to furnish this species with a\\r\\nnew appellation, and have selected that of _arborea_ as indicative of\\r\\nits habits; for in every part of Australia that I have visited, it\\r\\ninvariably selects the holes of trees for the purpose of nidification.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is strictly a summer visitant to Van Diemen’s Land and all the\\r\\nsouthern portions of Australia, arriving in August and retiring\\r\\nnorthwards as autumn approaches.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Tree Martin is a familiar species, frequenting the streets of the\\r\\ntowns in company with the Swallow. I observed it to be particularly\\r\\nnumerous in the streets of Hobart Town, where it arrives early in\\r\\nSeptember; the more southern and colder situation of the island\\r\\nrendering all migratory birds later in their arrival there.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt breeds during the month of October in the holes of trees, making no\\r\\nnest, but laying its eggs on the soft dust generally found in such\\r\\nplaces: the eggs are from three to five in number, of a pinky white\\r\\nfaintly freckled at the larger end with fine spots of light reddish\\r\\nbrown; they are eight lines long by six lines broad.\\r\\n\\r\\nIts food consists of insects of various kinds, particularly a species of\\r\\nsmall black fly.\\r\\n\\r\\nConsiderable difference exists both in size and in the depth of\\r\\ncolouring of specimens killed in New South Wales, Swan River and Van\\r\\nDiemen’s Land; but as there exists no distinctive character of marking,\\r\\nI am induced to regard them as mere local varieties rather than as\\r\\ndistinct species. The Van Diemen’s race are larger in all their\\r\\nadmeasurements, and have the fulvous tint of the under surface and the\\r\\nband across the forehead much deeper than in those killed in New South\\r\\nWales; individuals from the latter locality again exceed in size those\\r\\nfrom Western Australia.\\r\\n\\r\\nSpecimens from Van Diemen’s Land have the forehead crossed by a fulvous\\r\\nband; head, back of the neck, back and scapularies glossy bluish black;\\r\\nwings and tail brown; rump and upper tail-coverts light fulvous; throat,\\r\\nsides of the neck and flanks light fulvous, with a narrow stripe of dark\\r\\nbrown in the centre of each feather; centre of the abdomen nearly white;\\r\\nirides, bill and feet blackish brown.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe figures in the opposite Plate, which are of the natural size, were\\r\\ntaken from two of the varieties mentioned above; the upper one from a\\r\\nspecimen killed in New South Wales, the other two from birds taken in\\r\\nVan Diemen’s Land.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration:\\r\\n\\r\\n  CHELIDON ARIEL: _Gould_.\\r\\n\\r\\n  _J.

Soc., October 11, 1842.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nUntil my arrival in the colony of New South Wales I had no idea of the\\r\\nexistence of this new and beautiful Martin, nor in fact until I was\\r\\nawakened by its twittering notes at the bed-room window of the inn at\\r\\nMaitland, did I discover that I was surrounded by hundreds of this\\r\\nspecies, which were breeding under the verandahs and corners of the\\r\\nwindows, precisely after the manner of the Common Martin of Europe.\\r\\nSeveral of their bottle-shaped nests were built round the house, and\\r\\nfrom these I obtained as many eggs as I desired.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is numerously dispersed over all the southern portions of Australia,\\r\\nand like every other member of the genus it is strictly migratory,\\r\\nmaking the southern latitudes its summer residence. It usually arrives\\r\\nin the month of August and departs again in February or March; during\\r\\nthis interval it rears two or three broods. The Fairy Martin, unlike the\\r\\nfavourite Swallow of the Australians, although enjoying a most extensive\\r\\nrange, appears to have an antipathy to the country near the sea, for\\r\\nneither in New South Wales nor at Swan River have I ever heard of its\\r\\napproaching the coast-line nearer than twenty miles; hence while I never\\r\\nobserved it at Sydney, the town of Maitland on the Hunter is annually\\r\\nvisited by it in great numbers. In Western Australia it is common\\r\\nbetween Northam and York, while the towns of Perth and Fremantle on the\\r\\ncoast, are, like Sydney, unfavoured with its presence. I observed it\\r\\nthroughout the district of the Upper Hunter, as well as in every part of\\r\\nthe interior, breeding in various localities, wherever suitable\\r\\nsituations presented themselves, sometimes in the holes of low decayed\\r\\ntrees; while not unfrequently clusters of nests were attached to the\\r\\nperpendicular banks of rivers, the sides of rocks, &c., always, however,\\r\\nin the vicinity of water. The nest, which is bottle-shaped with a long\\r\\nneck, is composed of mud or clay, and like that of our Common Martin, is\\r\\nonly constructed in the morning and evening, unless the day be wet or\\r\\nlowery. In the construction of the nests they appear to work in small\\r\\ncompanies, six or seven assisting in the formation of each nest, one\\r\\nremaining within and receiving the mud brought by the others in their\\r\\nmouths: in shape they are nearly round, but vary in size from four to\\r\\nsix or seven inches in diameter; the spouts being eight, nine or ten\\r\\ninches in length. When built on the sides of rocks or in the hollows of\\r\\ntrees they are placed without any regular order, in clusters of thirty\\r\\nor forty together, some with their spouts inclining downwards, others at\\r\\nright angles, &c.; they are lined with feathers and fine grasses. The\\r\\neggs, which are four or five in number, are sometimes white, at others\\r\\nspotted and blotched with red; eleven-sixteenths of an inch long by half\\r\\nan inch broad.\\r\\n\\r\\nIts flight closely resembles that of the Common Martin; the stomach is\\r\\ntolerably muscular and the food consists of small flies.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sexes cannot be distinguished by their outward appearance.\\r\\n\\r\\nCrown of the head rust-red; back, scapularies and wing-coverts deep\\r\\nsteel-blue; wings and tail dark brown; rump buffy white; upper\\r\\ntail-coverts brown; under surface white, tinged with rust-red,\\r\\nparticularly on the sides of the neck and flanks; the feathers of the\\r\\nthroat with a fine line of dark brown down the centre; irides blackish\\r\\nbrown; bill blackish grey; legs and feet olive-grey.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe figures are of the natural size.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration:\\r\\n\\r\\n  MEROPS ORNATUS: _Lath._\\r\\n\\r\\n  _J.

Vigors and Horsfield sinking into a\\r\\nsynonym.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis bird has so many attractions that it will doubtless be always\\r\\nregarded as a general favourite with the Australians; the extreme beauty\\r\\nof its plumage, the elegance of its form and the graceful manner of its\\r\\nflight all combining to render it especially worthy of their notice;\\r\\nbesides which, many pleasing associations are connected with it, for,\\r\\nlike the Swallow and the Cuckoo of Europe, its arrival is a certain\\r\\nharbinger of the return of spring, which in the southern hemisphere is,\\r\\nas is well known, at the opposite period of the year to that of the\\r\\nnorthern; hence the Australian Bee-eater, which is strictly migratory,\\r\\narrives in New South Wales and all parts of the same latitude in August,\\r\\nand departs northwards in March, the intervening period being employed\\r\\nin the duties of incubation and of rearing its progeny. During the\\r\\nsummer months it is universally spread over the whole southern portion\\r\\nof the continent from east to west; and it will be interesting to\\r\\nornithologists generally, as it was to myself, to know that at Port\\r\\nEssington on the northern coast it is also strictly migratory, being\\r\\nabundantly dispersed over that part of the country when it is absent\\r\\nfrom the southern. “On my arrival at Port Essington in July,” says Mr.\\r\\nGilbert, “this bird was extremely abundant in every variety of\\r\\nsituation. It is a migratory bird in this part of Australia; a few pairs\\r\\nperhaps remaining to breed, as is evident from the natives being well\\r\\nacquainted with their mode of incubating, and also from my having in one\\r\\ninstance seen a pair of old birds with their young, which could not long\\r\\nhave left the nest as they were still being fed by their parents. With\\r\\nthe exception of these I did not observe this species in any part of the\\r\\nPeninsula or the adjacent islands, from the latter part of August to the\\r\\ntime of my leaving in the following March.”\\r\\n\\r\\nI have never seen this bird either in collections from New Guinea or\\r\\nfrom any other of the Indian islands; hence we may naturally conclude\\r\\nthat the extreme northern parts of Australia form the boundary of its\\r\\nrange in that direction, as New South Wales and the same degree of\\r\\nlatitude do on the southern. In South Australia and at Swan River it is\\r\\nequally numerous as in New South Wales, generally giving preference to\\r\\nthe inland districts rather than to those near the coast; hence it is\\r\\nrarely to be met with in the neighbourhood of Perth, while in the York\\r\\ndistrict it is very common. In New South Wales I found it especially\\r\\nabundant on the Upper Hunter, and all other parts towards the interior,\\r\\nas far as I had an opportunity of exploring. Its favourite resorts\\r\\nduring the day are the open, arid and thinly-timbered forests; and in\\r\\nthe evening the banks and sides of rivers, where numbers may frequently\\r\\nbe seen in company. It almost invariably selects a dead or leafless\\r\\nbranch whereon to perch, and from which it darts forth to capture the\\r\\npassing insect, much after the manner of many other of the Fissirostral\\r\\nbirds, particularly the Kingfishers, to which it also assimilates in the\\r\\nupright position it assumes while perched. Its flight somewhat resembles\\r\\nthat of the _Artami_, and although it is capable of being sustained for\\r\\nsome time, the bird more frequently performs short excursions, and\\r\\nreturns to the branch it had left.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have had frequent opportunities of observing both the eggs and young,\\r\\nwhich are deposited and reared in holes, made in the sandy banks of\\r\\nrivers or any similar situation in the forest favourable for the\\r\\npurpose. The entrance is about the size of a mouse-hole, and is\\r\\ncontinued for a yard in depth, at the end of which is an excavation of\\r\\nsufficient size for the reception of the parent, and the deposition on\\r\\nthe bare sand of four or five beautiful white eggs, which are ten lines\\r\\nlong by eight or nine lines broad.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe stomach is tolerably muscular, and the food consists of various\\r\\ninsects, principally coleoptera and neuroptera.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sexes are alike in plumage, and may be thus described:—\\r\\n\\r\\nForehead, line over the eye, back and wing-coverts brownish-green; crown\\r\\nof the head and nape orange-brown; wings orange-brown, passing into\\r\\ngreen on the extremities of the primaries, and broadly tipped with\\r\\nblack; two or three of the scapularies, lower part of the back, rump and\\r\\nupper tail-coverts cœrulean blue; tail black, most of the feathers,\\r\\nparticularly the two centre ones, slightly margined with blue; lores,\\r\\nline beneath and behind the eye and ear-coverts velvety black; beneath\\r\\nwhich is a stripe of cœrulean blue; throat rich yellow, passing into\\r\\norange on the sides of the neck; beneath this a broad band of deep\\r\\nblack; under surface like the back, becoming green on the lower part of\\r\\nthe abdomen; under tail-coverts light blue; irides light brownish red;\\r\\nbill black; legs and feet mealy greenish grey.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe young are destitute of the black on the throat, and of the blue line\\r\\nbeneath the eye.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe figures are of the natural size.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration:\\r\\n\\r\\n  EURYSTOMUS AUSTRALIS: _Swains._\\r\\n\\r\\n  _J.

From\\r\\nwhat I saw of it,—and I had opportunities of observing it almost daily\\r\\nfor some length of time,—it seemed to be most active about sun-rise and\\r\\nsunset, and during cloudy days; in sultry weather it was generally\\r\\nperched upon some dead branch in a state of quietude. It is a very bold\\r\\nbird at all times, but particularly so during the breeding-season, when\\r\\nit comes down with the utmost fury upon any intruder that may venture to\\r\\napproach the hole in the tree in which its eggs are deposited.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen engaged in the capture of insects it usually perches upon the dead\\r\\nupright branch of a tree growing beside and overhanging water, where it\\r\\nsits very erect, soaring all around until a passing insect attracts its\\r\\nnotice, when it suddenly darts off, secures its victim, and returns to\\r\\nthe same branch; at other times it may constantly be seen on the wing,\\r\\nmostly in pairs, flying just above the tops of the trees, diving and\\r\\nrising again with rapid turns in the most beautiful manner. During\\r\\nflight, which, when performed at a considerable elevation, is heavy and\\r\\nlaboured, the white spot in the centre of each wing, then widely\\r\\nexpanded, shows very distinctly, and hence the name of Dollar Bird\\r\\nbestowed upon it by the colonists.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is a very noisy bird, particularly in dull weather, when it often\\r\\nemits its peculiar chattering note during flight.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is said to take the young Parrots from their holes and kill them, but\\r\\nthis I never witnessed; the stomachs of the many I dissected contained\\r\\nnothing but the remains of coleoptera.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe breeding-season lasts from September to December; and the eggs,\\r\\nwhich are three and sometimes four in number, are deposited in the hole\\r\\nof a tree without any nest; they are of a beautiful pearly white,\\r\\nconsiderably pointed at the smaller end; their medium length is one inch\\r\\nand five lines, and breadth one inch and two lines.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sexes are alike in plumage.\\r\\n\\r\\nHead and neck dark brown, passing into the sea-green of the upper\\r\\nsurface, and deepening into black on the lores; spurious wing, outer\\r\\nwebs of the basal half of the quills, outer webs of the secondaries and\\r\\nthe basal half of the outer webs of the tail-feathers vivid blue; six of\\r\\nthe primaries with a greenish white basal band; extremities of the\\r\\nprimaries black; tail green at the base, black at the tip; throat vivid\\r\\nblue, with a stripe of lighter blue down the centre of each feather;\\r\\nunder surface of the shoulder and abdomen light green; under surface of\\r\\nthe inner webs of the primaries, and of all but the two centre\\r\\ntail-feathers deep blue, the former interrupted by the greenish white\\r\\nband; irides dark brown; eyelash, bill and feet red; inside of the mouth\\r\\nyellow.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe figures are of the natural size.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration:\\r\\n\\r\\n  DACELO GIGANTEA: _Leach_.\\r\\n\\r\\n  _J.

So remarkable are the sounds emitted by the bird that they\\r\\nhave been noted by nearly every writer on New South Wales and its\\r\\nproductions. Mr. Caley states that its “loud noise, somewhat like\\r\\nlaughing, may be heard at a considerable distance, from which\\r\\ncircumstance, and its uncouth appearance, it probably received the\\r\\nextraordinary appellation given to it by the settlers on their first\\r\\narrival in the colony.” Captain Sturt says, “Its cry, which resembles a\\r\\nchorus of wild spirits, is apt to startle the traveller who may be in\\r\\njeopardy, as if laughing and mocking at his misfortune;” and Mr.\\r\\nBennett, in his ‘Wanderings,’ says, “Its peculiar gurgling laugh,\\r\\ncommencing in a low and gradually rising to a high and loud tone, is\\r\\noften heard in all parts of the colony; the deafening noise being poured\\r\\nforth while the bird remains perched upon a neighbouring tree; it rises\\r\\nwith the dawn, when the woods re-echo with its gurgling laugh; at sunset\\r\\nit is again heard; and as that glorious orb sinks in the west, a last\\r\\n‘good night’ is given in its peculiar tones to all within hearing.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Great Brown Kingfisher does not inhabit Van Diemen’s Land, nor has\\r\\nit yet been met with in Western Australia; it may be said to be almost\\r\\nsolely confined to that portion of Australia lying between Spencer’s\\r\\nGulf and Moreton Bay, the south-eastern corner, as it were, of the\\r\\ncontinent. The plate in the Pl. Enl., quoted above, has been considered\\r\\nby all previous writers to have reference to this bird, and while I\\r\\ncoincide in this opinion, I think that some mistake must have arisen as\\r\\nto the locality, and that it never visits New Guinea nor even the\\r\\nnorthern coast of Australia, where its place is supplied by the _Dacelo\\r\\ncervina_ and _D. Leachii_. Unlike most other species, it frequents every\\r\\nvariety of situation; the luxuriant brushes stretching along the coast,\\r\\nthe more thinly-timbered forest, the belts of trees studding the parched\\r\\nplains and the brushes of the higher ranges being alike favoured with\\r\\nits presence; over all these localities it is rather thinly dispersed\\r\\nbeing nowhere very numerous.\\r\\n\\r\\nI believe that this bird seldom, if ever, drinks; consequently the most\\r\\narid plains are as suitable to its habits as the shrouded river sides\\r\\nand the flat brushes near the coast.\\r\\n\\r\\nIts food, which is of a mixed character, consists exclusively of animal\\r\\nsubstances; reptiles, insects and crabs, however, appear to be its\\r\\nfavourite diet, upon which it is destined by nature to subsist: it\\r\\ndevours lizards with avidity, and it is not an unfrequent sight to see\\r\\nit bearing off a snake in its bill to be eaten at leisure; it also preys\\r\\non small mammalia. I recollect shooting a Great Brown Kingfisher in\\r\\nSouth Australia in order to secure a fine rat I saw hanging from its\\r\\nbill, and which proved to be a rare species inhabiting the plains of\\r\\nthat part of the country. It breeds during the months of August and\\r\\nSeptember, and generally selects a hole in a large gum-tree for the\\r\\npurpose; making no nest, but depositing its beautiful pearl-white eggs,\\r\\nwhich are one inch and nine lines long by one inch and five lines broad,\\r\\non the decomposed wood at the bottom of the hole. When there are young\\r\\nones in it, it defends its breeding-place with great courage and daring,\\r\\ndarting down upon any intruder who may attempt to ascend the tree, and\\r\\ninflicting severe and dangerous blows with its pointed bill.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sexes present so little difference in the colouring of their\\r\\nplumage, that they are scarcely distinguishable from each other; neither\\r\\ndo the young at a month old exhibit any great variation from the adult,\\r\\nthe only difference being that the markings are somewhat darker and the\\r\\nbrown more generally diffused.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt bears confinement remarkably well, and is one of the most amusing\\r\\nbirds for the aviary with which I am acquainted: examples have been\\r\\nbrought alive to England; one lived for several years in the Gardens of\\r\\nthe Zoological Society of London, and at the moment I am writing (April\\r\\n1843) a fine individual brought from New South Wales by Mr. Yaldwyn, is\\r\\nnow living at his seat at Blackdown in Sussex, where it attracts the\\r\\nattention of every one by its singular actions and extraordinary notes,\\r\\nwhich are poured forth as freely as in its native wilds.\\r\\n\\r\\nForehead brown, each feather with a stripe of blackish brown down the\\r\\ncentre; crown of the head, lores, ear-coverts, and a broad band passing\\r\\nround the occiput blackish brown; space between the crown of the head\\r\\nand the band encircling the occiput, and the back of the neck buff,\\r\\ncrossed by fine irregular lines of dark brown; back and wings brownish\\r\\nblack; the wing-coverts and rump tipped with verditer green; primaries\\r\\nwhite at the base, black for the remainder of their length, and stained\\r\\nwith green on their outer margins immediately behind the white; upper\\r\\ntail-coverts blackish brown, crossed by several broad irregular bands of\\r\\nrusty red; tail brownish black, tipped with white, the white increasing\\r\\nin extent as the feathers recede from the centre; the central feathers\\r\\ncrossed near the tip with rusty red; the lateral feathers with brownish\\r\\nblack, the bands being very narrow near the tip, and gradually\\r\\nincreasing in breadth as they approach the base, where the white\\r\\ninterspaces also become tinged with rusty red; under surface pale buffy\\r\\nwhite, crossed by fine irregular freckled markings of dark brown; upper\\r\\nmandible brownish black; under mandible pale buff; feet olive; irides\\r\\ndark brown; eyelash olive-brown.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe figures represent a male and two young of the natural size.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration:\\r\\n\\r\\n  DACELO LEACHII: _Vig. & Horsf._\\r\\n\\r\\n  _J.

In disposition it appears to be more shy\\r\\nand wary than the _Dacelo gigantea_ of New South Wales, of which it is a\\r\\nrepresentative. Mr. Gilbert, whose observations were made on the Cobourg\\r\\nPeninsula, states that it “inhabits well-wooded forests, generally in\\r\\npairs, is extremely shy and very difficult to procure; it is very fond\\r\\nof perching on the topmost dead branch of a tree, where it has an\\r\\nuninterrupted view of every thing passing around, and pours out its loud\\r\\ndiscordant tones. Sometimes three or four pairs may be heard at one\\r\\ntime, when the noise is so great that no other sound can be heard.\\r\\n\\r\\n“The natives tell me that it breeds in the honey-season, which is during\\r\\nthe months of May, June and July.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe food of this Kingfisher is doubtless similar to that of the _Dacelo\\r\\ngigantea_. The stomachs of those examined by Mr. Gilbert were tolerably\\r\\nmuscular, and contained the remains of coleopterous and other kinds of\\r\\ninsects.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen fully adult the male differs from his mate in having the\\r\\ntail-feathers of a deep and splendid blue instead of brown; a feature\\r\\nwhich will be readily perceived on reference to the accompanying Plate.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe male has the feathers of the head buffy white, with a central stripe\\r\\nof dark brown, the latter colour becoming most conspicuous on the\\r\\nocciput; throat white; cheeks, ear-coverts, back of the neck, chest and\\r\\nall the under surface sienna-yellow, crossed on the flanks with very\\r\\nminute irregular zigzag bands of brown; primaries black at the tip,\\r\\nwhite at the base; the base of their external webs, the secondaries and\\r\\nspurious wing rich china blue; greater and lesser wing-coverts, lower\\r\\npart of the back and upper tail-coverts shining light blue; tail and the\\r\\nlongest of the upper tail-coverts rich deep blue, the former broadly\\r\\ntipped with white; irides greenish white; upper mandible blackish brown,\\r\\nthe cutting edges greenish white; lower mandible greenish white, the\\r\\nbase dark brown on the sides, and blue on the under surface; tarsi and\\r\\nfeet emerald green; claws black.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe female has the feathers of the head, cheeks, and ear-coverts buffy\\r\\nwhite, with a central stripe of dark brown; throat white; back of the\\r\\nneck, chest and all the under surface sienna-yellow; the chest, flanks\\r\\nand abdomen crossed by fine zigzag lines of brown; upper part of the\\r\\nback and scapularies umber-brown; primaries blackish brown at the tip\\r\\nand white at the base; the basal portion of their external webs, the\\r\\nsecondaries spurious and the wing rich china blue; greater and lesser\\r\\nwing-coverts and upper tail-coverts light shining blue; tail and the\\r\\nlongest of the upper coverts rich chestnut-brown, which passes into buff\\r\\nat the tip, the whole transversely marked with eight or nine bands of\\r\\nrich blue black.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe figures are those of the two sexes of the natural size.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration:\\r\\n\\r\\n  HALCYON SANCTUS: _Vig. & Horsf._\\r\\n\\r\\n  _J. & E.

I have specimens from\\r\\nnearly every locality: those from Port Essington on the north are\\r\\nprecisely identical with those of the south coast; on the other hand,\\r\\nthose inhabiting Western Australia are a trifle larger in all their\\r\\nmeasurements, but otherwise present no differences of sufficient\\r\\nimportance to warrant their being considered as distinct.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is a summer resident in New South Wales and throughout the southern\\r\\nportion of the continent, retiring northwards after the breeding-season.\\r\\nIt begins to disappear in December, and by the end of January few are to\\r\\nbe seen: solitary individuals may, however, be met with even in the\\r\\ndepth of winter. They return again in spring, commencing in August, and\\r\\nby the middle of September are plentifully dispersed over all parts of\\r\\nthe country, inhabiting alike the most thickly wooded brushes, the\\r\\nmangrove-forests which border, in many parts, the armlets of the sea,\\r\\nand the more open and thinly-timbered plains of the interior, often in\\r\\nthe most dry and arid situations far distant from water; and it would\\r\\nappear that, as is the case with many of the insectivorous birds of\\r\\nAustralia, a supply of that element is not essential to its existence,\\r\\nsince, from the localities it is often found breeding in, it must\\r\\nnecessarily pass long periods without being able to obtain it.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe brilliant and metallic lustre of its plumage renders it a\\r\\nconspicuous object in the bush: its loud piercing call, also, often\\r\\nbetrays its presence, particularly during the season of incubation, when\\r\\nthe bird becomes more and more clamorous as the tree in which its eggs\\r\\nare deposited is approached by the intruder. The note most frequently\\r\\nuttered is a loud _pee-pee_, continued at times to a great length,\\r\\nresembling a cry of distress. It sits very upright, generally perching\\r\\non a small dead branch for hours together, merely flying down to capture\\r\\nits prey, and in most instances returning again to the site it has just\\r\\nleft. Its food is of a very mixed character, and varies with the nature\\r\\nof the localities it inhabits. It greedily devours the manti,\\r\\ngrasshoppers and caterpillars, not refusing lizards and very small\\r\\nsnakes, all of which are swallowed whole, the latter being killed by\\r\\nbeating their heads against a stone or other hard substance, after the\\r\\nmanner of the Common Kingsfisher. Specimens killed in the neighbourhood\\r\\nof salt-marshes had their stomachs literally crammed with crabs and\\r\\nother crustaceous animals; while engaged in the capture of which it may\\r\\nbe observed sitting silently on the low mangrove-bushes skirting the\\r\\npools which every receding tide leaves either dry or with a surface of\\r\\nwet mud, upon which crabs are to be found in abundance. I have never\\r\\nseen it plunge into the water after fish like the true Kingsfishers, and\\r\\nI believe it never resorts to that mode of obtaining its prey. On the\\r\\nbanks of the Hunter its most favourite food is the larvæ of a species of\\r\\nant, which it procures by excavating holes in the nests of this insect\\r\\nwhich are constructed around the boles and dead branches of the\\r\\n_Eucalypti_, and which resemble excrescences of the tree itself.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe season of nidification commences in October and lasts till December,\\r\\nthe hollow spouts of the gum and boles of the apple trees being\\r\\ngenerally selected as a receptacle for the eggs, which are four or five\\r\\nin number, perfectly white, one inch and a line in length, and ten lines\\r\\nin diameter.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sexes present no difference either in their size or colouring, and\\r\\nthe young are only distinguished by being of a less brilliant hue, and\\r\\nby the wing-coverts and feathers of the breast being edged with brown.\\r\\n\\r\\nCrown of the head, back, and scapularies dull green; wings and tail\\r\\ngreen, slightly tinged with blue; ear-coverts, and an obscure circle\\r\\nbounding the green of the head, greenish black; rump verditer green;\\r\\nthroat white; line from the nostrils over the eye, nuchal band, and all\\r\\nthe under surface buff, becoming deeper on the flanks; bill black, the\\r\\nbasal portion of the under mandible flesh-white; feet flesh-red, tinged\\r\\nwith brown; irides dark brown.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Plate represents an old and a young bird of the natural size.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration:\\r\\n\\r\\n  HALCYON PYRRHOPYGIA: _Gould_.\\r\\n\\r\\n  _J. & E.

The only parts where I\\r\\nobserved it was the myall-brushes (_Acacia pendula_) of the Lower Namoi,\\r\\nparticularly those growing on the edge of the large plain skirting the\\r\\nNundawar range of Major Sir Thomas Mitchell. It was usually seen sitting\\r\\nvery upright on the dead branches of the myall- and gum-trees, sometimes\\r\\non those growing out on the hot plains, at others on those close by the\\r\\nriver-side. I succeeded in obtaining both old and young birds, which,\\r\\njudging from the size of the latter, I should suppose had left their\\r\\nbreeding-place about a month before I arrived in the neighbourhood of\\r\\nthe Namoi, in December. I also saw in this district the common or Sacred\\r\\nHalcyon, but in far less abundance than between the ranges and the\\r\\ncoast. This latter species may be hereafter found to be more exclusively\\r\\nan inhabitant of the country bordering the sea, while the Red-backed\\r\\nHalcyon may be exclusively a denizen of the distant interior. The\\r\\nunusual colouring of the back at once distinguishes it from all the\\r\\nother members of the genus inhabiting Australia, but in its general\\r\\neconomy and mode of living it presents no observable difference.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhether it remains during the whole of the year, or is a migratory bird\\r\\nlike the common species, I was not able to learn; for although Mr.\\r\\nCharles Coxen had previously informed me of the existence of such a\\r\\nHalcyon on the Namoi, he could give me no further account of it.\\r\\n\\r\\nCrown of the head dull green, intermingled with white, giving it a\\r\\nstriated appearance: a broad black stripe commences at the base of the\\r\\nbill, passes through the eye, and encircles the back of the head; upper\\r\\npart of the back and scapularies green; remainder of the wings bluish\\r\\ngreen; lower part of the back, rump, and upper tail-coverts red; tail\\r\\ngreen, tinged with blue; throat, a broad collar encircling the back of\\r\\nthe neck, and all the under surface white; bill black, the base of the\\r\\nlower mandible flesh-white; irides blackish brown; feet dark\\r\\nolive-brown.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe figure is of the natural size.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration:\\r\\n\\r\\n  HALCYON SORDIDUS: _Gould_.\\r\\n\\r\\n  _J.

It incubates in\\r\\nNovember and December, sometimes forming its nest in the hollow trunks\\r\\nof trees, and at others excavating a hole for itself in the nest of the\\r\\ntree-ants, which presents so prominent and singular a feature in the\\r\\nscenery of the country: the nest of the _H. Macleayii_ is easily\\r\\ndiscovered, for on the approach of an intruder the birds immediately\\r\\ncommence flying about in a very wild manner, uttering at the same time a\\r\\nloud piercing cry of alarm; the eggs are three or four in number, of a\\r\\npearly white and nearly round in form, being eleven lines long by ten\\r\\nbroad.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo much difference exists in the plumage of the sexes that Mr. Gilbert\\r\\nstates he was for some time induced to regard them as specifically\\r\\ndistinct; an error into which I had myself previously fallen when\\r\\ndescribing the female as a new species in the “Proceedings of the\\r\\nZoological Society” as quoted above; “but upon closer observation,” adds\\r\\nMr. Gilbert, “I soon satisfied myself that the difference of plumage was\\r\\nmerely sexual, the dissection of a large number of specimens fully\\r\\nproving that those with a ring round the neck are males and those\\r\\nwithout it females.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe male has a line under the eye and ear-coverts deep glossy black;\\r\\nhead, occiput, wings and tail rich deep prussian blue; primaries and\\r\\nsecondaries white at the base, forming a conspicuous spot when the wings\\r\\nare spread; for the remainder of their length these feathers are black,\\r\\nmargined externally with light prussian blue; immediately before the eye\\r\\nan oval spot of white; collar surrounding the back of the neck and all\\r\\nthe under surface white, tinged with buff on the lower part of the\\r\\nflanks; back and upper tail-coverts verditer blue; scapularies verditer\\r\\ngreen, both these colours bounded near the white collar with prussian\\r\\nblue; under surface of the wing white, the tips of the coverts black;\\r\\nunder surface of the tail black; bill black, the basal portion of the\\r\\nunder mandible yellowish white; tarsi black; inner side of the feet and\\r\\nback of the tarsi ash-grey; irides very dark brown.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe general colours of the female are similar to those of the male, but\\r\\nshe differs from her mate in being entirely destitute of the white\\r\\ncollar at the back of the neck, which part is deep prussian blue, thus\\r\\nuniting the blue of the occiput and of the back; in the tints being much\\r\\nless brilliant in the back, being of a dull brownish verditer green, and\\r\\nin the upper tail-coverts pale verditer green instead of blue; upper\\r\\nmandible black; lower mandible half-way from the tip and along the whole\\r\\nof the cutting edges black, the remainder being fleshy white tinged with\\r\\nblue where it joins the black; legs and feet greenish grey.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe young male resembles the female in colour, but is still less\\r\\nbrilliant; has the back of a purer green; the under surface tinged with\\r\\nbuff; the spot on the lores deep buff; and the collar at the back of a\\r\\ndeep buff, interrupted by some of the feathers of the occiput.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe figures are those of a male and a female of the natural size.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration:\\r\\n\\r\\n  ALCYONE AZUREA.\\r\\n\\r\\n  _J.

In size and in the brilliancy of its plumage, the Azure\\r\\nKingsfisher is intermediate between the species inhabiting the north\\r\\ncoast and that found in Van Diemen’s Land; although generically distinct\\r\\nfrom the Kingsfisher of Europe (_Alcedo Ispida_), it has many characters\\r\\nin common with that bird. It subsists almost exclusively on small fish\\r\\nand aquatic insects, which it captures in the water by darting down from\\r\\nsome bare branch overhanging the stream, and to which it generally\\r\\nreturns to kill and devour its prey, which is swallowed entire and head\\r\\nforemost, after the manner of the little favourite of our own island. It\\r\\nis a solitary bird, a pair, and frequently only one, being found at the\\r\\nsame spot. During the breeding-season it becomes querulous and active,\\r\\nand even pugnacious if any intruder of the same species should venture\\r\\nwithin the precincts of its abode. The males at this season have great\\r\\nconfidence, and chase each other up and down the stream with arrow-like\\r\\nquickness, the rich azure-blue of the back glittering in the sun, and\\r\\nappearing more like a meteor as it darts by the spectator than a bird.\\r\\nThe task of incubation commences in August and terminates in January,\\r\\nduring which period two broods are frequently brought forth. The eggs,\\r\\nwhich are of a beautiful pearly or pinkish white and rather round in\\r\\nform, are deposited at the extremity of a hole, in a perpendicular or\\r\\nshelving bank bordering the stream, without any nest being made for\\r\\ntheir reception; they are from five to seven in number, three quarters\\r\\nof an inch broad by seven-eighths of an inch long. The young at the\\r\\nfirst moult assume the plumage of the adult, which is never afterwards\\r\\nchanged. The hole occupied by the bird is frequently almost filled up\\r\\nwith the bones of small fish, which are discharged from the throat and\\r\\npiled up round the young in the form of a nest. Immediately on leaving\\r\\ntheir holes the young follow the parents from one part of the brook to\\r\\nanother, and are fed by them while resting on some stone or branch near\\r\\nthe water’s edge; they soon, however, become able to obtain their own\\r\\nfood, and may be observed at a very early age plunging into the water to\\r\\na considerable depth to capture small fish and insects.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sexes are precisely similar in the colouring of their plumage,\\r\\nneither do they differ in size. The young are very clamorous, frequently\\r\\nuttering their twittering cry as their parents pass and repass the\\r\\nbranch on which they are sitting.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll the upper surface and a patch on each side of the chest fine\\r\\nultramarine blue, becoming more vivid on the rump and upper\\r\\ntail-coverts; on each side of the neck behind the ear-coverts a tuft of\\r\\nyellowish white feathers; wings black; throat white, slightly washed\\r\\nwith buff; all the under surface, including the under side of the wing,\\r\\nferruginous orange, the flanks tinged with bluish lilac, giving them a\\r\\nrich purple hue; line from the bill to the eye reddish orange; irides\\r\\nand bill black; feet orange.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Plate represents the two sexes of the natural size.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration:\\r\\n\\r\\n  ALCYONE PUSILLA.\\r\\n\\r\\n  _J.

The extent of its\\r\\nrange northward has not yet been satisfactorily ascertained, beyond the\\r\\ncertainty that it has not hitherto been received in any collection from\\r\\nthe north coast.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt may be regarded as strictly migratory in Van Diemen’s Land, where it\\r\\narrives in October, the beginning of the Australian summer, and after\\r\\nrearing at least two broods departs again northwards in November. On the\\r\\ncontinent a scattered few remain throughout the year in all the\\r\\nlocalities favourable to its habits, the number being regulated by the\\r\\nsupply of insect food necessary for their subsistence. I may here\\r\\nobserve, that specimens from Swan River, South Australia and New South\\r\\nWales present no difference either in size or colouring, while those\\r\\nfrom Van Diemen’s Land are invariably larger in all their\\r\\nadmeasurements, and are also of a deeper colour; I regard them, however,\\r\\nas mere varieties of each other, the greater size of the latter being\\r\\ndoubtless caused by the superabundance of food which this more southern\\r\\nand humid climate affords.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis Wood Swallow, besides being the commonest species of the genus,\\r\\nmust I think be rendered a general favourite with the Australians, not\\r\\nonly from its singular and pleasing actions, but by its often taking up\\r\\nits abode and incubating near the houses, particularly such as are\\r\\nsurrounded by paddocks and open pasture-lands skirted by large trees. It\\r\\nwas in such situations as these in Van Diemen’s Land, at the\\r\\ncommencement of spring, that I first had an opportunity of observing\\r\\nthis species; it was then very numerous on all the cleared estates on\\r\\nthe north side of the Derwent, about eight or ten being seen on a single\\r\\ntree, and half as many crowding one against another on the same dead\\r\\nbranch, but never in such numbers as to deserve the appellation of\\r\\nflocks: each bird appeared to act independently of the other; each, as\\r\\nthe desire for food prompted it, sallying forth from the branch to\\r\\ncapture a passing insect, or to soar round the tree and return again to\\r\\nthe same spot; on alighting it repeatedly throws up and closes one wing\\r\\nat a time, and spreads the tail obliquely prior to settling. At other\\r\\ntimes a few were seen perched on the fence surrounding the paddock, on\\r\\nwhich they frequently descended, like Starlings, in search of coleoptera\\r\\nand other insects. It is not, however, in this state of comparative\\r\\nquiescence that this graceful bird is seen to the greatest advantage,\\r\\nneither is it that kind of existence for which its form is especially\\r\\nadapted; for although its structure is more equally suited for\\r\\nterrestrial, arboreal and aërial habits than that of any other species I\\r\\nhave examined, the form of its wing at once points out the air as its\\r\\npeculiar province: hence it is, that when engaged in pursuit of the\\r\\ninsects which the serene and warm weather has enticed from their\\r\\nlurking-places among the foliage to sport in higher regions, this\\r\\nbeautiful species in these aërial flights displays its greatest beauty,\\r\\nwhile soaring above, in a variety of easy positions, with white-tipped\\r\\ntail widely spread. Another very extraordinary and singular habit of the\\r\\nbird is that of clustering like bees on the dead branch of a tree, as\\r\\nrepresented in the Plate; this feature was not seen by me, but by my\\r\\nassistant Mr. Gilbert, during his residence at Swan River, and I have\\r\\nhere given his account in his own words. “The greatest peculiarity in\\r\\nthe habits of this bird is its manner of suspending itself in perfect\\r\\nclusters, like a swarm of bees; a few birds suspending themselves on the\\r\\nunder side of a dead branch, while others of the flock attach themselves\\r\\none to the other, in such numbers that they have been observed nearly of\\r\\nthe size of a bushel measure.”\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was very numerous in the town of Perth until about the middle of\\r\\nApril, when I missed it suddenly, nor did I observe it again until near\\r\\nthe end of May, when I saw it in countless numbers flying in company\\r\\nwith the Common Swallows and Martens over a lake about ten miles north\\r\\nof the town; so numerous, in fact, were they, that they darkened the\\r\\nwater as they flew over it.\\r\\n\\r\\nIts voice greatly resembles that of the Common Swallow in character, but\\r\\nis much more harsh.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe stomach is muscular and capacious, and the food consists of insects\\r\\ngenerally.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe season of incubation is from September to December. The situation of\\r\\nthe nest is much varied; I have seen one placed in a thickly foliaged\\r\\nbough near the ground, while others were in a naked fork, on the side of\\r\\nthe hole of a tree, in a niche formed by a portion of the bark having\\r\\nbeen separated from the trunk, &c. The nest is rather shallow, of a\\r\\nrounded form, about five inches in diameter, and composed of fine twigs\\r\\nneatly lined with fibrous roots. I observed that the nests found in Van\\r\\nDiemen’s Land were larger, more compact and more neatly formed than\\r\\nthose on the continent of Australia; and one which was shown me by Mr.\\r\\nJustice Montague on his picturesque estate at Kangaroo Point, near\\r\\nHobart Town, was placed at the extremity of a small leafy branch, as\\r\\nrepresented in the Plate.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe eggs are generally four in number; they differ much in the\\r\\ndisposition of their markings; their ground-colour is dull white,\\r\\nspotted and dashed with dark umber-brown; in some a second series of\\r\\ngreyish spots appear as if beneath the surface of the shell; their\\r\\nmedium length is eleven lines, and breadth eight lines.\\r\\n\\r\\nHead, neck, and the whole of the body fuliginous grey; wings dark bluish\\r\\nblack, the external edges of the second, third and fourth primaries\\r\\nwhite; tail bluish black, all the feathers except the two middle ones\\r\\nlargely tipped with white; irides dark brown; bill blue with a black\\r\\ntip; feet mealy lead-colour.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sexes are alike in the colouring of their plumage, and are only to\\r\\nbe distinguished by the female being somewhat smaller in size.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe young have an irregular stripe of dirty white down the centre of\\r\\neach feather of the upper surface, and are mottled with the same on the\\r\\nunder surface.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Plate represents a male and female of the natural size.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration:\\r\\n\\r\\n  ARTAMUS MINOR: _Vieill._\\r\\n\\r\\n  _J.

During\\r\\nfine weather, and even in the hottest part of the day, it floats about\\r\\nin the air in the most easy and graceful manner, performing in the\\r\\ncourse of its evolutions many beautiful curves and circles, without the\\r\\nleast apparent motion of the wings, whose silvery whiteness as seen from\\r\\nbeneath, together with the snowy tips of its wide-spread tail, offer a\\r\\nstrong contrast to the dark colouring of the other parts of its plumage.\\r\\n\\r\\nI found it abundant on the Lower Namoi, particularly on the plains\\r\\nthinly studded with the _Acacia pendula_ and other low trees in the\\r\\nneighbourhood of Gummel-Gummel, where it had evidently been breeding, as\\r\\nI observed numerous young ones, whose primaries were not sufficiently\\r\\ndeveloped to admit of their performing a migration of any distance;\\r\\nbesides which, they were constantly being fed by the parents, who were\\r\\nhawking about in the air over and around the trees, while the young were\\r\\nquietly perched on some dead twig, as represented in the accompanying\\r\\nPlate, where two adults and three young are figured, in the manner in\\r\\nwhich they are seen huddled together in a state of nature.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have not yet heard of this species having been seen within the\\r\\nprescribed limits of the colony of New South Wales, neither is it a\\r\\nnative of Southern or Western Australia.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have received two specimens from Port Essington, and I believe the\\r\\nexamples in the Paris Museum were from Timor, which proves that it has a\\r\\nwide range northwards of the Namoi; and I shall not be surprised if\\r\\nfuture research should ascertain it to be very generally distributed\\r\\nover the interior of the Australian continent, not as a summer visitant\\r\\nonly, but as a permanent resident.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sexes are alike in plumage, but the young differ considerably, as\\r\\nshown in the Plate, a reference to which will give a more correct idea\\r\\nof their appearance and markings than any description.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe whole of the head, back, and abdomen chocolate-brown; wings, rump,\\r\\nand under tail-coverts bluish black; tail deep bluish black, all the\\r\\nfeathers except the two outer and two middle ones tipped with white;\\r\\nbill beautiful violet-blue at the base, darker at the tip; irides and\\r\\nfeet nearly black.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe figures are of the natural size.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration:\\r\\n\\r\\n  ARTAMUS CINEREUS. _Vieill._\\r\\n\\r\\n  _J.

Like them it\\r\\npossesses a very extensive range of habitat, Mr. Robert Brown having\\r\\nfound it at Broad Sound on the east, and Mr. Gilbert on the west coast;\\r\\nit is also a native of Timor.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Western Australia, although a very local, it is by no means an\\r\\nuncommon species, particularly at Swan River, where it inhabits the\\r\\nlimestone hills near the coast, and the “Clear Hills” of the interior,\\r\\nassembling in small families, and feeding upon the seeds of the\\r\\n_Xanthorrhœa_ which proves that insects do not form the sole diet of\\r\\nthis species; with such avidity in fact does it devour the ripe seeds of\\r\\nthis grass-tree, that several birds may frequently be seen crowded\\r\\ntogether on the perpendicular seed-stalks of this plant busily engaged\\r\\nin extracting them; at other times, particularly among the limestone\\r\\nhills, where there are but few trees, it descends to the broken rocky\\r\\nground in search of insects and their larvæ.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt breeds in October and November, making a round compact nest, in some\\r\\ninstances of fibrous roots, lined with fine hair-like grasses, in others\\r\\nof the stems of grasses and small plants; it is built either in a\\r\\nscrubby bush or among the grass-like leaves of the _Xanthorrhœa_, and is\\r\\ndeeper and more cup-shaped than those of the other members of the group.\\r\\nThe eggs are subject to considerable variation in colour and in the\\r\\ncharacter of their markings; they are usually bluish white, spotted and\\r\\nblotched with lively reddish brown, intermingled with obscure spots and\\r\\ndashes of purplish grey; all the markings being most numerous towards\\r\\nthe larger end; they are about eleven lines long by eight lines broad.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sexes are alike in colour, and can only be distinguished from each\\r\\nother with certainty by dissection. I have remarked that specimens from\\r\\nTimor rather exceed in size those collected on the Australian continent,\\r\\nand are somewhat lighter in colour; but these variations are too slight\\r\\nto be regarded as specific.\\r\\n\\r\\nCrown of the head, neck, throat and chest grey, passing into sooty grey\\r\\non the abdomen; space between the bill and the eye, the forepart of the\\r\\ncheek, the chin, the upper and under tail-coverts jet-black; two middle\\r\\ntail-feathers black; the remainder black, largely tipped with white,\\r\\nwith the exception of the outer feather on each side, in which the black\\r\\ncolouring extends on the outer web nearly to the tip; wings deep grey;\\r\\nprimaries bluish grey; under surface of the shoulder white, passing into\\r\\ngrey on the under side of the primaries; irides dark blackish brown;\\r\\nbill light greyish blue at the base, black at the tip; legs and feet\\r\\ngreenish grey.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe figures are those of a male and a female of the natural size.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration:\\r\\n\\r\\n  ARTAMUS ALBIVENTRIS: _Gould_.\\r\\n\\r\\n  _J.

Soc., March 23, 1847.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTwo examples of this species are all that have come under my notice; one\\r\\nof these was killed on the Darling Downs in New South Wales, and the\\r\\nother some distance to the northward of that locality, it being one of\\r\\nthe birds procured during Dr. Leichardt’s expedition to Port Essington.\\r\\nIts nearest ally is the _Artamus cinereus_, a species inhabiting the\\r\\nopposite side of the continent; but it is somewhat smaller, and may\\r\\nmoreover be distinguished from that bird by the white under\\r\\ntail-coverts, and the lighter colour of the lower part of the abdomen. I\\r\\nregret that I have no information to communicate respecting its habits\\r\\nand economy; they are doubtless very similar to those of its\\r\\nrepresentative above alluded to.\\r\\n\\r\\nLores, space beneath the eye and the chin deep black; head, neck and\\r\\nupper part of the back brownish grey; lower part of the back and the\\r\\nwings dark grey, becoming gradually deeper towards the tips of the\\r\\nfeathers; primaries and secondaries narrowly edged with white at the\\r\\ntip; under surface of the wing white; ear-coverts, chest and abdomen\\r\\npale grey, passing into white on the under tail-coverts; upper\\r\\ntail-coverts and tail black; the apical third of all but the two middle\\r\\nones white; irides dark brown; bill yellowish horn-colour, becoming\\r\\nblack at the tip; feet blackish brown.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe figures are of the natural size.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration:\\r\\n\\r\\n  ARTAMUS PERSONATUS: _Gould_.\\r\\n\\r\\n  _J.

My\\r\\nknowledge of the range of this species is very limited; a single\\r\\nspecimen was sent me from South Australia, while the fine examples from\\r\\nwhich my figures were taken were killed by Mr. Gilbert in the colony of\\r\\nSwan River. Its richly coloured black face and throat, separated from\\r\\nthe delicate grey of the breast by a narrow line of snowy white, at once\\r\\ndistinguishes it from every other species, while the strong contrast of\\r\\nthese colours renders it a conspicuous object among the trees.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn size and structure it more nearly resembles the _Artamus\\r\\nsuperciliosus_ than any other, and the two species form beautiful\\r\\nanalogues of each other, one being in all probability confined to the\\r\\neastern portion of the country, and the other to the western.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I have only met,” says Mr. Gilbert, “with this species in the York and\\r\\nZoodyay districts. It is very like _Artamus sordidus_ in its habits, but\\r\\nis more shy and retired, never being seen but in the most secluded parts\\r\\nof the bush. It is merely a summer visitant here, generally making its\\r\\nappearance in the latter part of October, and immediately commencing the\\r\\ntask of incubation. Its voice very much resembles the chirping of the\\r\\nEnglish Sparrow.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Its nest is placed in the upright fork of a dead tree, or in the hollow\\r\\npart of the stump of a grass-tree; it is neither so well nor so neatly\\r\\nformed as those of the other species of the group, being a frail\\r\\nstructure externally composed of a very few extremely small twigs, above\\r\\nwhich is a layer of fine dried grasses. The eggs also differ as\\r\\nremarkably as the nest, their ground colour being light greenish grey,\\r\\ndashed and speckled with hair-brown principally at the larger end, and\\r\\nslightly spotted with grey, appearing as if beneath the surface of the\\r\\nshell; they are ten and a half lines long by eight and a half lines\\r\\nbroad. I found two nests in a York Gum Forest, about five miles to the\\r\\neast of the Avon River: each of these contained two eggs, which I\\r\\nbelieve is the usual number.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Its food consists of insects generally and their larvæ.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe male has the face, ear-coverts and throat jet-black, bounded below\\r\\nwith a narrow line of white; crown of the head sooty black, gradually\\r\\npassing into the deep grey, which covers the whole of the upper surface,\\r\\nwings and tail; the latter tipped with white; all the under surface very\\r\\ndelicate grey; thighs dark grey; irides blackish brown; bill blue at the\\r\\nbase, becoming black at the tip; legs and feet mealy bluish grey.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe female differs in having the colouring of the bill and the black\\r\\nmask on the face much paler.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe figures are those of a male and a female of the natural size.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration:\\r\\n\\r\\n  ARTAMUS SUPERCILIOSUS: _Gould_.\\r\\n\\r\\n  _J.

Soc., Part IV.\\r\\n            1836, p. 142; and in Syn. Birds of Australia, Part I. fig.\\r\\n            2.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is no species of _Artamus_ yet discovered to which the present\\r\\nyields the palm, either for elegance of form or for the beauty and\\r\\nvariety of its plumage; the only known species with which it could be\\r\\nconfounded is the _Artamus rufiventer_, an Indian bird with the breast\\r\\nsimilarly marked, but which is entirely destitute of the superciliary\\r\\nstripe of white, which has suggested the specific name; in this\\r\\ncharacter and in the rich chestnut colouring of the breast, it differs\\r\\nfrom every member of its tribe inhabiting Australia. I am unable to say\\r\\nwhat is the extent of its range, but I am induced to believe that it is\\r\\nconfined to Australia, and that in all probability it seldom leaves the\\r\\ninterior of the country; the extreme limits of the colony of New South\\r\\nWales, particularly those which border the extensive plains, being the\\r\\nonly parts where it has yet been observed. I first met with it at\\r\\nYarrundi on the Dartbrook, a tributary of the Hunter, where it was\\r\\nthinly dispersed among the trees growing on the stony ridges bordering\\r\\nthe flats.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom this locality to as far as I penetrated northwards on the Namoi, as\\r\\nwell as in the direction of the River Peel, it was distributed in\\r\\nsimilar numbers, intermingled with the _Artamus sordidus_, at about the\\r\\nratio of one hundred pairs to the square mile, the two species appearing\\r\\nto live and perform the task of incubation in perfect harmony, both\\r\\nbeing frequently observed on the same tree. In their dispositions,\\r\\nhowever, and in many of their actions they are somewhat dissimilar; the\\r\\nbird forming the subject of the present Plate being much more shy and\\r\\ndifficult of approach than the _Artamus sordidus_, which is at all times\\r\\nvery tame; it also gives a preference to the topmost branches of the\\r\\nhighest trees, from which it sallies forth for the capture of insects,\\r\\nand to which it again returns, in the usual manner of the tribe. In\\r\\nevery part where I have observed it, it is strictly migratory, arriving\\r\\nin summer, and departing northwards after the breeding-season.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe nest is ever most difficult of detection, being generally placed\\r\\neither in a fork of the branches or in a niche near the bole of the\\r\\ntree, whence the bark had been partially stripped. It is a round, very\\r\\nshallow and frail structure, composed of small twigs and lined with\\r\\nfibrous roots; those I discovered contained two eggs, but I had not\\r\\nsufficient opportunities for ascertaining if this number was constant.\\r\\nTheir ground-colour is dull buffy white, spotted with umber-brown,\\r\\nforming a zone near the larger end; in some these spots are sparingly\\r\\nsprinkled over the whole surface; they have also the obscure grey\\r\\nspotting like those of _A. sordidus_; the eggs are rather more than\\r\\neleven lines long by eight and a half lines broad.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe male has the lores, space surrounding the eye, and the ear-coverts\\r\\ndeep black; chin greyish black passing into blackish grey on the chest;\\r\\ncrown of the head greyish black; over each eye a pure white stripe\\r\\ncommencing in a point, and gradually becoming wider or spatulate in form\\r\\nas it proceeds towards the occiput; all the upper surface, wings and\\r\\ntail fuliginous grey, which is lightest on the rump and tail; all the\\r\\ntail-feathers tipped with white, except the outer web of the lateral\\r\\nfeather, which is grey; under surface of the wing pure white; all the\\r\\nunder surface rich deep chestnut; irides nearly black; bill light blue\\r\\nat the base, black at the tip; feet dark lead-colour.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe female has a similar distribution of colouring, but differs from her\\r\\nmate in the following particulars: lores and a ring surrounding the eye\\r\\njet-black; only an indication of the superciliary stripe; throat grey;\\r\\ntail not so distinctly tipped with white; under surface light\\r\\nchestnut-red.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe figures are those of a male and a female of the natural size.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration:\\r\\n\\r\\n  ARTAMUS LEUCOPYGIALIS: _Gould_.\\r\\n\\r\\n  _J.

Soc., February 8,\\r\\n            1842.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOn a careful comparison of specimens of the White-rumped _Artami_ from\\r\\nIndia and the Indian Archipelago with those killed in Australia, I\\r\\ncannot but consider that at least two, if not three, species have been\\r\\nconfounded under one name, and that the Australian bird had remained\\r\\nundescribed until characterized by me at the Meeting of the Zoological\\r\\nSociety above quoted. The present species is most nearly allied to the\\r\\n_Artamus leucorhynchus_, but is readily distinguished from it by the\\r\\nblue colour of the bill; and I may here remark, that all the Australian\\r\\nbirds have the bill fine pale blue, and are also considerably smaller in\\r\\nall their admeasurements than those of the islands to the northwards.\\r\\n\\r\\nVan Diemen’s Land and Western Australia are the only colonies in which\\r\\nthis bird has not been observed; its range, therefore, over the\\r\\ncontinent may be considered as very general: in South Australia and New\\r\\nSouth Wales it would appear to be migratory, visiting those parts in\\r\\nsummer for the purpose of breeding. Among other places where I observed\\r\\nit in considerable abundance was Mosquito, and the other small islands\\r\\nnear the mouth of the Hunter, and on the borders of the rivers Mokai and\\r\\nNamoi, situated to the northward of Liverpool Plains; in these\\r\\nlast-mentioned localities it was breeding among the large flooded\\r\\ngum-trees bordering the rivers.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe breeding-season commences in September and continues until January,\\r\\nduring which period at least two broods are reared. In the Christmas\\r\\nweek of 1839, at which time I was on the plains of the interior, in the\\r\\ndirection of the Namoi, the young progeny of the second brood were\\r\\nperched in pairs or threes together, on a dead twig near their nest, as\\r\\nrepresented in the Plate. They were constantly visited and fed by the\\r\\nadults, who were hawking about for insects in great numbers, some\\r\\nperforming their evolutions above the tops and among the branches of the\\r\\ntrees, while others were sweeping over the open plain with great\\r\\nrapidity of flight, making in their progress through the air the most\\r\\nrapid and abrupt turns; at one moment rising to a considerable altitude\\r\\nand the next descending to within a few feet of the ground, as the\\r\\ninsects of which they were in pursuit arrested their attention. In the\\r\\nbrushes, on the contrary, the flight of this bird is more soaring and of\\r\\na much shorter duration, particularly when hawking in the open glades,\\r\\nwhich frequently teem with insect life. When flying near the ground the\\r\\nwhite mark on the rump shows very conspicuously, and strikingly reminds\\r\\none of the House Marten of our own country.\\r\\n\\r\\nTwo nests, taken in November on a small island in Coral Bay, near the\\r\\nentrance of the harbour at Port Essington, were compactly formed of\\r\\ndried wiry grass and the fine plants growing on the beach; they were\\r\\nplaced in a fork of a slender mangrove-tree within fifteen feet of the\\r\\nwater, in which they were growing; but like several other Australian\\r\\nbirds, the _Artamus leucopygialis_ often avails itself of the deserted\\r\\nnests of other species instead of building one of its own. Most of those\\r\\nI found breeding on the Mokai had possessed themselves of the forsaken\\r\\nnest of the _Grallina Melanoleuca_, which they had rendered warm and of\\r\\nthe proper size by slightly lining it with grasses, fibrous roots, and\\r\\nthe narrow leaves of the _Eucalypti_. The eggs are generally three in\\r\\nnumber, are much lighter in colour, and more minutely spotted than those\\r\\nof any other species of the genus I have seen; their ground-colour is\\r\\nflesh-white, finely freckled and spotted with faint markings of reddish\\r\\nbrown and grey, in some instances forming a zone at the larger end:\\r\\ntheir medium length is ten lines, and breadth seven lines and a half.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sexes are only to be distinguished by dissection, and may be\\r\\ndescribed thus: head, throat and back sooty grey; primaries and tail\\r\\nbrownish black washed with grey; chest, all the under surface and rump\\r\\npure white; irides brown; bill light bluish grey at the base, black at\\r\\nthe tip; legs and feet mealy greenish grey.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Plate represents a male, a female, two young ones and a nest of the\\r\\nnatural size.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration:\\r\\n\\r\\n  DICÆUM HIRUNDINACEUM.\\r\\n\\r\\n  _J. & E.

It is also frequently\\r\\nto be seen among the branches of the beautiful parasite figured in the\\r\\naccompanying Plate: this charming _Loranthus_ was gathered at Dartbrook,\\r\\non the Upper Hunter, where it is very common on the _Casuarinæ_. Whether\\r\\nthe bird is attracted to this misseltoe-like parasite, like many others,\\r\\nfor the purpose of feeding upon its sweet and juicy berries, I could not\\r\\nfully make out; its chief food is insects, but in all probability it may\\r\\npartially feed on these fruits also.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Swallow Dicæum has neither the actions of the Pardalotes nor of the\\r\\nHoney-eaters; it differs from the former in its quick darting flight,\\r\\nand from the latter in its less prying, clinging and creeping actions\\r\\namong the leaves, &c. When perched on a branch it sits more upright, and\\r\\nis more Swallow-like in its contour than either of the forms alluded to;\\r\\nthe structure of its nest and the mode of its nidification are also very\\r\\ndissimilar.\\r\\n\\r\\nIts song is a very animated and long-continued strain, but is uttered so\\r\\ninwardly, that it is almost necessary to stand beneath the tree upon\\r\\nwhich the bird is perched, before its notes can be heard.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt would appear that the range of this species extends to all parts of\\r\\nthe Australian continent, since I have received specimens from every\\r\\nlocality yet explored by Europeans. I found it breeding on the Lower\\r\\nNamoi, which proves that the interior of the country is inhabited by it\\r\\nas well as those portions between the ranges and the coast.\\r\\n\\r\\nIts beautiful purse-like nest, of which the drawing will give a far\\r\\nbetter idea than the most minute description, is composed of the white\\r\\ncotton-like substance found in the seed-vessels of many plants, and\\r\\namong other trees is sometimes suspended on a small branch of a\\r\\n_Casuarina_ or an _Acacia pendula_. It was on the latter tree that I\\r\\nfound a nest containing three or four young; a second nest with the eggs\\r\\nwas given to me in Sydney. The ground-colour of the eggs is dull white,\\r\\nwith very minute spots of brown scattered over the surface; they are\\r\\nnine lines long by five and a half lines broad.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe male has the head, all the upper surface, wings and tail black,\\r\\nglossed with steel-blue; primaries black; throat, breast, and under\\r\\ntail-coverts scarlet; flanks dusky; abdomen white, with a broad patch of\\r\\nblack down the centre; irides dark brown; bill blackish brown; feet dark\\r\\nbrown.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe female is dull black above, glossed with steel-blue on the wings and\\r\\ntail; throat and centre of the abdomen buff; flanks light brown; under\\r\\ntail-coverts pale scarlet.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe figures are of the natural size, on a branch of the _Loranthus_\\r\\nabove mentioned, which I believe to be an undescribed species.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration:\\r\\n\\r\\n  PARDALOTUS PUNCTATUS: _Vieill._\\r\\n\\r\\n  _J.

It is nearly always engaged in searching for insects\\r\\namong the foliage, both of trees of the highest growth and of the lowest\\r\\nshrubs; it frequents gardens and enclosures as well as the open forest;\\r\\nand is exceedingly active in its actions, clinging about in every\\r\\nvariety of position both above and beneath the leaves with equal\\r\\nfacility.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith regard to the nidification of this species, it is a singular\\r\\ncircumstance, that in the choice of situation for the reception of its\\r\\nnest, it differs from every other known member of the genus; for while\\r\\nthey always place their nests in the holes of trees, this species\\r\\ndescends to the ground, and availing itself of any little shelving bank\\r\\nthat occurs in its vicinity, excavates a hole just large enough to admit\\r\\nof the passage of its body, in a nearly horizontal direction to the\\r\\ndepth of two or three feet, at the end of which a chamber is formed in\\r\\nwhich the nest is deposited. The nest itself is a neat and beautifully\\r\\nbuilt structure, formed of strips of the inner bark of the _Eucalypti_,\\r\\nand lined with finer strips of the same or similar materials; it is of a\\r\\nspherical contour, about four inches in diameter, with a small hole in\\r\\nthe side for an entrance. The chamber is generally somewhat higher than\\r\\nthe mouth of the hole, by which means the risk of its being inundated\\r\\nupon the occurrence of rain is obviated. I have been fortunate enough to\\r\\ndiscover many of the nests of this species, but they are most difficult\\r\\nto detect, and are only to be found by watching for the egress or\\r\\ningress of the parent birds from or into its hole or entrance, which is\\r\\nfrequently formed in a part of the bank overhung with herbage, or\\r\\nbeneath the overhanging roots of a tree. How so neat a structure as is\\r\\nthe nest of the Spotted Pardalote, should be constructed at the end of a\\r\\nhole where no light can possibly enter is beyond our comprehension, and\\r\\nis one of those wonderful results of instinct so often presented to our\\r\\nnotice in the history of the animal creation, without our being in any\\r\\nway able to account for them. The present species rears two broods in\\r\\nthe course of the year, the eggs upon each occasion being four or five\\r\\nin number, rather round in form, of a beautiful polished fleshy white,\\r\\nseven and a half lines long by six and a half lines broad.\\r\\n\\r\\nIts voice is a rather harsh piping note of two syllables often repeated.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe male has the crown of the head, wings, and tail black, each feather\\r\\nhaving a round spot of white near the tip; a stripe of white commences\\r\\nat the nostrils and passes over the eye; ear-coverts and sides of the\\r\\nneck grey; feathers of the back grey at the base, succeeded by a\\r\\ntriangular-shaped spot of fawn-colour, and edged with black; rump rufous\\r\\nbrown; upper tail-coverts crimson; throat, chest, and under tail-coverts\\r\\nyellow; abdomen and flanks tawny; irides dark brown; bill brownish\\r\\nblack; feet brown.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe female may be distinguished by the less strongly contrasted tints of\\r\\nher colouring, and by the absence of the bright yellow on the throat.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe figures represent the two sexes of the natural size.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration:\\r\\n\\r\\n  PARDALOTUS RUBRICATUS: _Gould_.\\r\\n\\r\\n  _J.

It belongs to the same section\\r\\nof the _Pardaloti_ as the _P. punctatus_ and _P. quadragintus_, and like\\r\\nthem is distinguished from the other members of the group by the absence\\r\\nof the sealing-wax-like tips of the spurious wing-feathers,—a character\\r\\nwhich is constant in the _P. uropygialis_, _P. affinis_, _P. striatus_\\r\\nand _P. melanocephalus_. It is the largest species of the genus yet\\r\\ndiscovered, all the members of which are confined to Australia; and is\\r\\nreadily distinguished from its near allies the _P. punctatus_ and _P.\\r\\nquadragintus_ by the larger size of the spots on the crown, and by its\\r\\nhaving less yellow on the throat than the former, and more than the\\r\\nlatter.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs nothing whatever is at present known respecting it, it is one of\\r\\nthose species I would especially recommend to the notice of those\\r\\nfavourably situated for observing it.\\r\\n\\r\\nForehead crossed by a narrow band of dirty white; crown and back of the\\r\\nhead deep black, each feather having a spot of white near its extremity;\\r\\nback of the neck, back, wing-coverts and rump brownish grey; wings dark\\r\\nbrown, margined with pale brown, the spurious wing, a small portion of\\r\\nthe base of the primaries, and the outer margins of the secondaries fine\\r\\ngolden orange; immediately before the eye a spot of bright, fiery\\r\\norange; above and behind the eye a stripe of buff; upper tail-coverts\\r\\nbright olive-green; tail deep blackish brown, the extreme tips of the\\r\\nfeathers being white; throat and abdomen greyish white; chest bright\\r\\nyellow; upper mandible and legs brown, under mandible greyish white.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe bird is represented in two positions, of the natural size, on a\\r\\nplant gathered in New South Wales.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration:\\r\\n\\r\\n  PARDALOTUS QUADRAGINTUS: _Gould_.\\r\\n\\r\\n  _J.

It is I think less numerous than its congener,\\r\\nthe _Pardalotus affinis_, and appears to confine itself more exclusively\\r\\nto the highest gum-trees than that species. I found it very abundant in\\r\\nthe gulleys under Mount Wellington, and observed it breeding in a hole\\r\\nin one of the loftiest trees, at about forty feet from the ground; I\\r\\nafterwards took a perfectly developed white egg from the body of a\\r\\nfemale killed on the 5th of October. The weight of this little bird was\\r\\nrather more than a quarter of an ounce; the stomach was muscular, and\\r\\ncontained the remains of the larvæ of lepidoptera, which with coleoptera\\r\\nand other insects constitute its food.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt has a simple piping kind of note of two syllables.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn its actions it much resembles the Tits of Europe, creeping and\\r\\nclinging among the branches in every direction.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe eggs are white and nearly round in form, being seven lines and a\\r\\nhalf long and six broad.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sexes are so much alike in colour, that a separate description is\\r\\nunnecessary.\\r\\n\\r\\nCrown of the head and all the upper surface bright olive-green, each\\r\\nfeather obscurely margined with brown; wings brownish black, all the\\r\\nfeathers except the first and second primaries having a conspicuous spot\\r\\nof pure white near their extremities; tail blackish grey, the extreme\\r\\ntips of the feathers being white; cheeks and under tail-coverts\\r\\nyellowish olive; throat and under surface greyish white, passing into\\r\\nolive on the flanks; irides dark brown; bill brownish black; feet brown.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe figures are of the natural size.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration:\\r\\n\\r\\n  PARDALOTUS STRIATUS: _Vig. & Horsf._\\r\\n\\r\\n  _J.

I have carefully examined specimens killed at Swan River\\r\\nwith others from New South Wales, and I cannot find the slightest\\r\\ndifference either in their size or markings. It will be interesting to\\r\\nknow how far this species and the _P. punctatus_ extend their range\\r\\nnorthwards, a point which can only be ascertained when the country has\\r\\nbeen fully explored. The _P. uropygialis_ is the only species that has\\r\\nyet been discovered on the north coast. This active little bird is\\r\\ngenerally seen seeking insects among the leaves, for which purpose it\\r\\nfrequents trees of every description, but gives a decided preference to\\r\\nthe _Eucalypti_. Its flight is rapid and darting, hence it passes from\\r\\ntree to tree, or from one part of the forest to another with the\\r\\ngreatest ease. Its voice is a double note several times repeated.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe nest, which is a very neat structure of dried soft grasses and the\\r\\nbark of the tea-tree, lined with feathers, is usually placed in a hole\\r\\nof a dead branch, but sometimes in the boll of the tree. It breeds in\\r\\nSeptember, October and November, and lays three or four fleshy-white\\r\\neggs, which are nine lines long by seven lines broad.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sexes so closely assimilate in colour and markings that they are\\r\\nonly to be distinguished by dissection.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe young assume the adult colouring from the nest, but have the tips of\\r\\nthe spurious wing orange instead of red.\\r\\n\\r\\nForehead and crown of the head black, the feathers of the latter having\\r\\na stripe of white down the centre; a stripe of deep orange-yellow\\r\\ncommences at the base of the upper mandible and runs above the eye,\\r\\nwhere it is joined by a stripe of white which leads to the occiput; back\\r\\nof the neck and back brownish olive-grey; rump and upper tail-coverts\\r\\nyellowish brown; wings black, the external edges of the third, fourth,\\r\\nfifth, sixth and seventh primaries white at their base and tipped with\\r\\nwhite; secondaries margined with white and reddish brown; tail black,\\r\\neach feather tipped with white; sides of the face and neck grey; throat\\r\\nand upper part of the chest yellow; centre of the abdomen white; flanks\\r\\nand under tail-coverts brownish buff, the former tinged with yellow;\\r\\nirides brownish red; bill at the tip and along the culmen dark brown\\r\\ntinged with blue, the remainder yellowish white; legs and feet greenish\\r\\ngrey.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Plate represents a male, a female, and three young birds of the\\r\\nnatural size.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration:\\r\\n\\r\\n  PARDALOTUS AFFINIS: _Gould_.\\r\\n\\r\\n  _J. & E.

Birds of Australia, Part II.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe _Pardalotus affinis_ is distinguished by the yellow tips of its\\r\\nspurious wings and by the margin of the third primary only being white.\\r\\nThe bird figured by Shaw and Latham, as quoted above, has in all\\r\\nprobability reference to the present species, but not, in my opinion, to\\r\\nthe _Pipra striata_ of Gmelin, whose description does not agree with the\\r\\nVan Diemen’s Land bird, or with any of those from New South Wales; he\\r\\ndistinctly states that the tips of some of the wing-coverts are yellow,\\r\\nand that the spurious wing is tipped with white, and, moreover, adds\\r\\nthat it is a native of South America.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Allied Pardalote is distributed over every part of Van Diemen’s\\r\\nLand, and may be regarded as the commonest bird of the island: wherever\\r\\nthe gum and wattle exist there also may the bird as certainly be found;\\r\\ngiving no decided preference to trees of a high or low growth, but\\r\\ninhabiting alike the sapling and those which have attained their\\r\\ngreatest altitude. It displays great activity among the branches,\\r\\nclinging and creeping about in the most easy and elegant manner,\\r\\nexamining both the upper and under sides of the leaves with the utmost\\r\\ncare in search of insects. It is equally common in all the gardens and\\r\\nshrubberies, even those in the midst of the towns, forming a familiar\\r\\nand pleasing object, and enlivening the scenery with its sprightly\\r\\nactions, and piping, though somewhat monotonous note. Its food consists\\r\\nof seeds, buds, and insects, in procuring which its most elegant actions\\r\\nare brought into play.\\r\\n\\r\\nI am led to believe that it is strictly confined to Van Diemen’s Land\\r\\nand the islands in Bass’s Straits, having never observed it on the\\r\\nmainland, or seen specimens in any one of the numerous collections I\\r\\nhave examined from New South Wales.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe season of nidification occupies at least four months, during which\\r\\ntwo or more broods are reared. Eggs may be found in September, and on\\r\\nreference to my journal I find that near George Town, on the 8th of\\r\\nJanuary, I took from a nest in the hole of a tree five fully-fledged\\r\\nyoung. The nest in this instance was of a large size, and of a round\\r\\ndomed form like that of the Wren, with a small hole for an entrance; it\\r\\nwas outwardly composed of grasses and warmly lined with feathers. The\\r\\neggs vary from three to five in number, and are of a beautiful white,\\r\\nnine lines long by seven lines in diameter.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe holes selected for the nest are sometimes high up in the loftiest\\r\\ntrees, at others within a few feet of the ground. The young birds have\\r\\nthe tips of the spurious wing orange instead of yellow; and although the\\r\\nwhole plumage possesses the same character as that of the adults, the\\r\\nmarkings are less brilliant and well-defined. The sexes offer no\\r\\nobservable difference in their colouring by which they can be\\r\\ndistinguished.\\r\\n\\r\\nForehead and crown of the head black, the latter with a stripe of white\\r\\ndown the centre of each feather; a stripe of yellow commences at the\\r\\nbase of the upper mandible, and runs above the eye, where it is joined\\r\\nby a stripe of white, which proceeds nearly to the occiput; back of the\\r\\nneck and back greyish olive-brown; rump and upper tail-coverts\\r\\nolive-brown; wings black, each of the primaries slightly tipped with\\r\\nwhite, and the third externally edged with white; the secondaries edged\\r\\nwith white and rufous, and the tips of the spurious wing yellow; tail\\r\\nblackish brown, each feather having a transverse mark of white at the\\r\\ntip; ear-coverts and cheeks grey; throat yellow, passing into lighter\\r\\nyellow on the flanks; centre of the abdomen white; irides olive-brown;\\r\\nbill black; feet brown.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe figures are of the natural size.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration:\\r\\n\\r\\n  PARDALOTUS MELANOCEPHALUS: _Gould_.\\r\\n\\r\\n  _J.

It is more closely allied to my _Pardalotus\\r\\nmelanocephalus_ than any other species; but as the latter is without the\\r\\nyellow on the rump, and has a larger bill, I am induced to regard them\\r\\nas distinct.\\r\\n\\r\\nI am unable to give any account of its habits and manners, but in these\\r\\nrespects it doubtless closely assimilates to the other members of its\\r\\ngroup.\\r\\n\\r\\nCrown of the head, stripe before and behind the eye black; lores rich\\r\\norange; a mark from above the eye to the occiput, chest and centre of\\r\\nthe abdomen white; throat and cheeks delicate crocus-yellow; rump and\\r\\nupper tail-coverts sulphur-yellow; back of the neck and back olive-grey;\\r\\nwings black, the external webs of the second and five following\\r\\nprimaries white at the base; tips of the spurious wing scarlet; tail\\r\\nblack; the three outer feathers tipped with white, the white spreading\\r\\nlargely over the inner web of the outer feathers; bill black; feet lead\\r\\ncolour.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sexes do not differ in size or in the colour of their plumage.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe figures are of the natural size.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration:\\r\\n\\r\\n  STREPERA GRACULINA: _Lefs._\\r\\n\\r\\n  _J.

Gray, Gen. of Birds, 2nd Edit., p. 50.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThis species was originally described and figured in White’s ‘Voyage to\\r\\nNew South Wales’: it is consequently the oldest and most familiarly\\r\\nknown member of the group to which it belongs. It is very generally\\r\\ndistributed over the colony of New South Wales, inhabiting alike the\\r\\nbrushes near the coast, those of the mountain ranges, and also the\\r\\nforests of _Eucalypti_ which clothe the plains and more open country. As\\r\\na great part of its food consists of seeds, berries and fruits, it is\\r\\nmore arboreal in its habits than some of the other species of its group,\\r\\nwhose structure better adapts them for progression on the ground, and\\r\\nwhose food principally consists of insects and their larvæ. The habitat\\r\\nof the present bird appears to be confined to the south-eastern portions\\r\\nof the continent, where, as is the case with all birds whose range is so\\r\\nlimited, it is a stationary species, merely moving from one district to\\r\\nanother according to the season; at one time being more numerous on the\\r\\nopen coast, and at another among the brushes, as each may offer it a\\r\\ngreater variety or more abundant supply of food: the hilly portions of\\r\\nthe country intersected with deep ravines are, however, decidedly its\\r\\nmost congenial localities. Like the other members of the genus it is\\r\\nmostly seen in small companies, varying from four to six in number,\\r\\nseldom either singly or in pairs: I am not, however, inclined to\\r\\nconsider them as gregarious birds in the strict sense of the word,\\r\\nbelieving as I do that each of these small companies is composed of a\\r\\npair and their progeny, which appear to keep together from the birth of\\r\\nthe latter until the natural impulse for pairing prompts them to\\r\\nseparate.\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir flight is very different from that of the Crow, (which they much\\r\\nresemble in outward appearance) being much less protracted, and never of\\r\\nan elevated character; its utmost extent is from one part of the forest\\r\\nto another, or across a gully, in effecting which they sometimes pass\\r\\nover the tops of the trees, while at others they accomplish the distance\\r\\nby flitting from tree to tree. It is during flight that the markings of\\r\\nthis bird are displayed to the greatest advantage, the strong contrast\\r\\nof its colours then rendering it a conspicuous object in the bush: while\\r\\non the wing also it frequently causes the woods to ring with its\\r\\npeculiar noisy cry, by which its presence is often indicated when\\r\\notherwise it would not be seen. On the ground it hops over the surface\\r\\nwith the greatest facility.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe nest, which is usually constructed on the branches of low trees,\\r\\nsometimes even on those of the _Casuarinæ_, is of a large size, round,\\r\\nopen, and cup-shaped, built of sticks and lined with moss and grasses;\\r\\nthe eggs, which I was not so fortunate as to procure, are generally\\r\\nthree or four in number.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe flesh of this species is frequently eaten by the colonists, and is\\r\\nby some considered a delicacy.\\r\\n\\r\\nOf all the species of this singular and well-defined genus, the present,\\r\\nalthough not the largest in stature, is by far the handsomest, its\\r\\nmarkings being more clearly defined and the tints of its plumage more\\r\\nrich and contrasted than those of any of its congeners, the black being\\r\\nas deep as jet, and the white pure and unspotted; it differs also from\\r\\nall its allies yet discovered in having the basal half of the primaries\\r\\nand the basal half and the tips of the tail-feathers together with those\\r\\nportions of the shafts pure white.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe plumage of both sexes at all ages is so precisely similar, that by\\r\\ndissection alone can we distinguish the male from his mate, or the young\\r\\nfrom the adult; the female is, however, always a trifle less in all her\\r\\nadmeasurements, and the young birds have the corners of the mouth more\\r\\nfleshy and of a brighter yellow than the adults.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll the plumage fine bluish black with the exception of the basal half\\r\\nof the primaries, the basal half and the tips of the tail-feathers,\\r\\nincluding those portions of their shafts and the under tail-coverts\\r\\nwhich are snow-white; irides beautiful yellow; bill and feet black.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration:\\r\\n\\r\\n  STREPERA FULIGINOSA: _Gould_.\\r\\n\\r\\n  _J.

Its browner colouring, more arched and gibbose bill,\\r\\nits smaller size, and the absence of the white colouring of the under\\r\\ntail-coverts and of the base of the primaries, are characters by which\\r\\nit may at once be distinguished from all the other members of the group.\\r\\nThe localities it frequents are also of a different description, those\\r\\npreferred being low swampy grounds in the neighbourhood of the sea and\\r\\nwoods bordering rivers. Like the other species of the genus, it subsists\\r\\non insects and grubs of various kinds, to which pulpy seeds and berries\\r\\nare frequently added.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is very active on the ground, running over the surface with a motion\\r\\nbetween a run and a hop with great rapidity.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt breeds in the low trees, constructing a large, deep and cup-shaped\\r\\nnest very similar to that of the European Crow, and lays three eggs, of\\r\\na pale vinous brown marked all over with large irregular blotches of\\r\\nbrown, one inch and five-eighths long by one inch and a quarter broad.\\r\\n\\r\\nIts note is much less shrill than that of the _Strepera arguta_.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have seen this bird in a state of captivity, and it appeared to bear\\r\\nconfinement remarkably well.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sexes present no visible difference except in size, the female being\\r\\nsmaller than the male; they may be thus described:—\\r\\n\\r\\nAll the plumage sooty black, with the exception of the ends of the\\r\\nprimaries and all but the two middle tail-feathers, which are white;\\r\\nirides bright yellow; bill and feet black.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe figures are of the natural size.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration:\\r\\n\\r\\n  STREPERA ARGUTA: _Gould_.\\r\\n\\r\\n  _J.

Soc., Part XIV. p. 19.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe _Strepera arguta_ is abundantly dispersed over Van Diemen’s Land,\\r\\nbut is more numerous in the central parts of the island than in the\\r\\ndistricts adjacent to the coast; it also inhabits South Australia, in\\r\\nwhich country it is more scarce, and all the specimens I have seen are\\r\\nrather smaller in size. I have never seen it in any part of New South\\r\\nWales that I have visited, neither have specimens occurred in the\\r\\nnumerous collections from the west coast that have come under my notice.\\r\\nIt is the largest, the boldest and the most animated species of the\\r\\ngenus yet discovered. If not strictly gregarious, it is often seen in\\r\\nsmall companies of from four to ten, and during the months of winter\\r\\neven a greater number are to be seen congregated together. The districts\\r\\nmost suited to its habits are open glades in the forest and\\r\\nthinly-timbered hills: although it readily perches on the trees, its\\r\\nnatural resort is the ground, for which its form is admirably adapted,\\r\\nand over which it passes with amazing rapidity, either in a succession\\r\\nof leaps or by running. Fruits being but sparingly diffused over\\r\\nAustralia, insects necessarily constitute almost its sole food, and of\\r\\nthese nearly every order inhabiting the surface of the ground forms part\\r\\nof its diet. It devours grasshoppers with great avidity, and as these\\r\\ninsects are ever most abundant, the one would appear to be formed for\\r\\nthe sustenance of the other.\\r\\n\\r\\nIts note is a loud ringing and very peculiar sound, somewhat resembling\\r\\nthe words _clink, clink_, several times repeated, and strongly reminded\\r\\nme of the distant sound of the strokes on a blacksmith’s anvil; and\\r\\nhence the term _arguta_ appeared to me to be an appropriate specific\\r\\nappellation for this new species.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll the nests I found of this species either contained young birds or\\r\\nwere without eggs; I am consequently unable to give their size and\\r\\ncolour. The nest, which is of a large size, is generally placed on a\\r\\nhorizontal branch of a low tree; it is round, deep and cup-shaped,\\r\\noutwardly formed of sticks and lined with fibrous roots and other fine\\r\\nmaterials.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sexes present no external difference whatever, neither is there much\\r\\ndifference in size; the young are black from the nest, except that the\\r\\ntertiary feathers are strongly tipped with white, a character never I\\r\\nbelieve thrown off in adult age.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll the plumage brownish black, becoming much browner on the tips of the\\r\\nwing-feathers, and of a grey tint on the abdomen; base of the inner webs\\r\\nof the primaries and secondaries, the under tail-coverts and the apical\\r\\nthird of the inner webs of the tail-feathers white; irides\\r\\norange-yellow; bill and feet black; corner of the mouth yellow.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Plate represents the bird about four-fifths of the size of life.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration:\\r\\n\\r\\n  STREPERA ANAPHONENSIS.\\r\\n\\r\\n  _J.

Temminck, and of sinking that of _plumbea_ into a\\r\\nsynonym.\\r\\n\\r\\nNo one species of the genus has so wide a range as the present,\\r\\nextending as it does from New South Wales on the east to Swan River on\\r\\nthe west coast. It is, however, more local in its habitat than any of\\r\\nthem, at least such is the case in New South Wales; for although it is\\r\\ntolerably abundant at Illawarra, at Camden, and in the park of C.\\r\\nThrosby, Esq., at Bong-bong, it was not seen in any other district that\\r\\nI visited. Mr. Gilbert states that he observed it in every part of\\r\\nWestern Australia visited by him; and that he mostly met with it in the\\r\\nthickly wooded forests, singly or in pairs, feeding on the ground with a\\r\\ngait and manners very much resembling the Common Crow. Its flight is\\r\\neasy and long-sustained, and it occasionally mounts to a considerable\\r\\nheight in the air.\\r\\n\\r\\nIts note is a piercing shriek, very much resembling in sound the native\\r\\nname.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe stomach is very muscular, and the food consists of coleoptera and\\r\\nthe larvæ of insects of various kinds.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt breeds in the latter part of September and the beginning of October,\\r\\nforming a nest of dried sticks in the thickest part of the foliage of a\\r\\ngum- or mahogany-tree and laying three eggs, the ground-colour of which\\r\\nis either reddish buff or wood-brown, marked over nearly the whole of\\r\\nthe surface with blotches of a darker tint; their medium length is one\\r\\ninch and nine lines by one inch and two and a half lines broad.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sexes resemble each other so closely in colour, that it is\\r\\nimpossible to distinguish the one from the other, except by dissection.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll the upper surface leaden grey, becoming much darker on the forehead\\r\\nand lores; wings black; secondaries margined with grey and tipped with\\r\\nwhite; basal half of the inner webs of the primaries white, of the outer\\r\\nwebs grey; the remainder of their length black, slightly tipped with\\r\\nwhite; tail black, margined with grey and largely tipped with white; all\\r\\nthe under surface greyish brown; under tail-coverts white; irides\\r\\norange; bill and feet black.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe figure represents a male of the natural size.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration:\\r\\n\\r\\n  GYMNORHINA TIBICEN: _G.

Gray, List of Gen. of Birds, 2nd edit. p.\\r\\n            50.\\r\\n\\r\\n  _Ca-ruck_, Aborigines of New South Wales.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThis species is universally diffused over the colony of New South Wales,\\r\\nto which part of the Australian continent I believe its habitat to be\\r\\nconfined. It is true that a bird of this genus inhabits the\\r\\nneighbourhood of Swan River, whose size and style of plumage is very\\r\\nsimilar, but which I have little doubt will prove to be distinct. In\\r\\nfact, from what we see in other instances, it is natural to expect that\\r\\nthere would be a species of this genus on the western as well as on the\\r\\neastern side of the country, and that they would, as representatives of\\r\\neach other, be very nearly allied; I shall therefore consider the\\r\\nhabitat of the present bird to be restricted to New South Wales until I\\r\\nhave further proofs to the contrary.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe _Gymnorhina Tibicen_ is a bold and showy bird, which, when not\\r\\nharassed and driven away, greatly enlivens and ornaments the lawns and\\r\\ngardens of the colonists by its presence, and with the slightest\\r\\nprotection from molestation becomes so tame and familiar that it\\r\\napproaches close to their dwellings, and perches round them and the\\r\\nstock yards in small families of from six to ten in number. Nor is its\\r\\nmorning carol less amusing and attractive than its pied and strongly\\r\\ncontrasted plumage is pleasing to the eye. To describe the notes of this\\r\\nbird is beyond the power of my pen, and it is a source of regret to\\r\\nmyself that my readers cannot, as I have done, listen to them in their\\r\\nnative wilds, or that the bird is not introduced into this country in\\r\\nsufficient numbers for it to become generally known; a more amusing and\\r\\neasily-kept denizen for the aviary could not be selected. As it dwells\\r\\nin New South Wales all the year round, breeds upon the trees bordering\\r\\nthe cleared lands, and constructs a nest as large and conspicuous as\\r\\nthat of the Crow of our own island, there can be no difficulty in\\r\\nprocuring as many young ones as might be desired; and I trust,\\r\\ntherefore, that whenever opportunities occur for sending living examples\\r\\nto England they will not be neglected.\\r\\n\\r\\nCleared lands, open flats and plains skirted by belts of trees are its\\r\\nfavourite localities, hence the interior of the country is more\\r\\nfavourable to its habits than the neighbourhood of the coast.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt lives almost entirely on insects, which are generally procured on the\\r\\nground, and the number of locusts and grasshoppers it devours is\\r\\nimmense. In captivity it subsists upon animal food of almost every kind,\\r\\nand that berries and fruits would be equally acceptable I have but\\r\\nlittle doubt.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe breeding-season commences in August and lasts until January, during\\r\\nwhich period two broods are generally reared by each pair of birds. The\\r\\nnest is round, deep and open, composed outwardly of sticks, leaves,\\r\\nwool, &c., and lined with any finer materials that may be at hand. The\\r\\neggs are either three or four in number; their colour and size I regret\\r\\nto say I cannot give, having unfortunately neglected to procure them\\r\\nwhile in New South Wales. Of two other and much rarer species I possess\\r\\nthe eggs; and although I might from analogy proceed to describe those of\\r\\nthe present bird from them, I refrain from so doing.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe young assume the plumage of the adult from the nest, and no change\\r\\ntakes place from age or season.\\r\\n\\r\\nCrown of the head, cheeks, throat, back, all the under surface,\\r\\nscapularies, secondaries, primaries and tips of the tail-feathers black;\\r\\nwing-coverts, nape of the neck, upper and under tail-coverts, and base\\r\\nof the tail-feathers white; bill bluish ash-colour at the base, passing\\r\\ninto black at the tip; irides rich reddish hazel; legs black.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Plate represents the male and female, with the nest, rather less\\r\\nthan the natural size.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration:\\r\\n\\r\\n  GYMNORHINA LEUCONOTA: _Gould_.\\r\\n\\r\\n  _J.

Tibicen_, inhabits South Australia, and\\r\\nextends its range as far to the eastward as the colony of New South\\r\\nWales. I hear that it is tolerably abundant at Port Philip, and that it\\r\\nis sometimes seen on the plains near Yass. For my own part I have never\\r\\nmet with it in New South Wales, but observed it to be rather abundant in\\r\\nSouth Australia. In the extreme shyness of its disposition it presents a\\r\\nremarkable contrast to the _G. Tibicen_; it was indeed so wary and so\\r\\ndifficult to approach, that it required the utmost ingenuity to obtain a\\r\\nsufficient number of specimens necessary for my purpose. Plain and open\\r\\nhilly parts of the country are the localities it prefers, where it\\r\\ndwells much on the ground, feeding upon locusts and other insects. In\\r\\nsize it is fully as large as any species of the genus yet discovered; it\\r\\nruns over the ground with great facility, and the long flights it\\r\\nfrequently takes across the plains from one belt of trees to another,\\r\\nindicated greater powers of flight than is possessed by its near allies;\\r\\nin other parts of its economy it so nearly resembles the _G. Tibicen_,\\r\\nthat it would be useless to repeat a description of them here. The same\\r\\nsingle note and early carol of small companies perched on some leafless\\r\\nbranch of a _Eucalyptus_ appears characteristic of all the members of\\r\\nthe genus.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt breeds in September and October, constructing a nest of dried sticks\\r\\nin an upright fork of a gum- or mahogany-tree. The eggs are three in\\r\\nnumber, very long in form, and of a dull bluish white, in some instances\\r\\ntinged with red, marked with large bold blotches or zigzag streakings of\\r\\nbrownish red or light chestnut; the average length of the eggs is one\\r\\ninch and eight lines, and breadth one inch and one line. Occasionally\\r\\neggs are met with which are spotted with black or umber-brown.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sexes when fully adult present no other outward difference than the\\r\\nlarger size of the female. Immature birds of both sexes have the whole\\r\\nof the back clouded with grey, and the bill of a less pure ash-colour.\\r\\n\\r\\nBack of the neck, back, upper and under coverts of the wings, basal\\r\\nportion of the spurious wing, upper and under tail-coverts, and base of\\r\\nthe tail-feathers white; remainder of the plumage and the shafts of the\\r\\nwhite portion of the tail-feathers glossy black; irides light hazel;\\r\\nbill bluish lilac-purple, passing into black at the tip; legs and feet\\r\\nblackish grey.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Plate represents the two sexes rather less than the size of life.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration:\\r\\n\\r\\n  GYMNORHINA ORGANICUM: _Gould_.\\r\\n\\r\\n  _J.

Birds of Australia, Part I.\\r\\n\\r\\n  _Organ-Bird_ and _White Magpie_ of the Colonists.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThis animated and elegant bird is a native of Van Diemen’s Land, and\\r\\nappears to be very local in its habitat, for while it is never found\\r\\nbelow Austin’s Ferry on the southern bank of the river Derwent, it is\\r\\nvery plentiful on the opposite side and in the interior of the country,\\r\\nparticularly on the salt-pan plains, which would be dreary indeed were\\r\\nthey not enlivened by the presence of this amusing bird, the Miners\\r\\n(_Myzanthæ_), and the Rose Hill Parrakeet. It is also to be met with in\\r\\nall the open parts of the country, in small troops of from six to twelve\\r\\nor more in number; but I did not observe it on the banks of the Tamar,\\r\\nand it certainly does not inhabit Flinders’ Island. It runs, and\\r\\noccasionally hops, over the surface with great quickness, but flies\\r\\nrather slowly, and upon alighting on a branch raises and closes one wing\\r\\nseveral times in quick succession, and in a very peculiar manner. When\\r\\non the plains it utters a loud ringing call, but when perched on the\\r\\ndead branches of the trees soon after day-break, it pours forth a\\r\\nsuccession of notes of the strangest description that can be imagined,\\r\\nmuch resembling the sounds of a hand-organ out of tune, which has\\r\\nobtained for it the colonial name of the Organ-Bird. It is very easily\\r\\ntamed; and as it possesses the power of imitation in an extraordinary\\r\\ndegree, it may be readily taught to whistle various tunes as well as to\\r\\narticulate words; it consequently soon becomes a most amusing as well as\\r\\nornamental bird for the aviary or cage. The stomach is very muscular,\\r\\nand the food consists of insects of various kinds, grubs, caterpillars,\\r\\n&c., which are procured on the ground.\\r\\n\\r\\nA nest I found was placed among the topmost branches of a high gum-tree,\\r\\nwas round, cup-shaped, and outwardly constructed of sticks interspersed\\r\\nwith strips of bark, short grasses, and tufts of a species of swamp\\r\\ngrass, to which succeeded an internal lining of coarse grass, which\\r\\nagain was lined with the inner bark of the stringy bark-tree, sheep’s\\r\\nwool and a few feathers, felted together and forming a dense and warm\\r\\nreceptacle for the eggs; it was about ten inches in diameter, and about\\r\\nfour or five inches in depth.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe eggs were four in number, of a lengthened form with a ground-colour\\r\\nof greenish ashy grey, spotted and blotched, particularly at the larger\\r\\nend, with umber-brown and bluish grey, the latter colour appearing as if\\r\\nbeneath the surface of the shell; they were one inch and five lines long\\r\\nby one inch broad. The young assume the adult livery from the nest, and\\r\\nappear to keep in company of the parent birds during the first ten\\r\\nmonths of their existence.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe male has the crown of the head, cheeks, throat, all the under\\r\\nsurface, scapularies, primaries and tips of the tail jet-black; nape of\\r\\nthe neck, back, upper and under tail-coverts, and base of the\\r\\ntail-feathers white; bill dark lead-colour at the base, passing into\\r\\nblack at the tip; legs black; irides bright hazel.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe female differs in having the nape of the neck and back grey, and the\\r\\nprimaries and tips of the tail-feathers brownish black.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Plate represents the two sexes of the natural size.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration:\\r\\n\\r\\n  CRACTICUS NIGROGULARIS: _Gould_.\\r\\n\\r\\n  _J.

He states that it is an extremely shy and wary\\r\\nbird, inhabiting the most secluded parts of the forest, and is as\\r\\nfrequently seen searching for its food on the ground as among the\\r\\ntopmost branches of the highest trees. In its habits, manners, mode of\\r\\nflight, and in its loud, discordant, organ-pipe-like voice, it closely\\r\\nresembles the other members of the genus. It is usually seen in pairs,\\r\\nor in small families of four or five. Its nest is built of sticks in the\\r\\nupright fork of a thickly-foliaged tree, at about thirty or forty feet\\r\\nfrom the ground.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe stomach is muscular, and the food consists of insects of various\\r\\nkinds, but principally of coleoptera.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sexes are not to be distinguished by any markings in the plumage,\\r\\nbut the young are dressed in a brown colouring like those of the other\\r\\nmembers of the genus.\\r\\n\\r\\nCollar at the back of the neck, centre and edge of the wing, rump,\\r\\nabdomen, under tail-coverts and tips of all but the centre tail-feathers\\r\\nwhite, remainder of the plumage deep black; irides dark reddish brown;\\r\\nbill ash-grey, the tip black; legs and feet dark greenish grey.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Plate represents the two sexes of the natural size.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration:\\r\\n\\r\\n  CRACTICUS ARGENTEUS: _Gould_.\\r\\n\\r\\n  _J.

Its presence is at all times\\r\\nbetrayed by its extraordinary note, a jumble of discordant sounds\\r\\nimpossible to be described. It is nearly always on the trees, where it\\r\\nsits motionless on some dead or exposed branch whence it can survey all\\r\\naround, and particularly the surface of the ground beneath, to which it\\r\\nmakes perpendicular descents to secure any large insect or lizard that\\r\\nmay attract its sharp and penetrating eye; it usually returns to the\\r\\nsame branch to devour what it has captured, but at times will resort to\\r\\nother trees and impale its victim after the manner of the true Shrikes:\\r\\nmice, small birds, and large _Phasmiæ_ come within the list of its\\r\\nordinary diet. September and the three following months constitute the\\r\\nperiod of incubation. The nest, which is large and cup-shaped, is neatly\\r\\nformed of sticks, and in some instances beautifully lined with the\\r\\nshoots of the _Casuarina_ and fibrous roots. Considerable difference is\\r\\nfound to exist in the colour of the eggs, the ground colouring of some\\r\\nbeing dark yellowish brown, with obscure blotches and marks of a darker\\r\\nhue, and here and there a few black marks not unlike small blots of ink;\\r\\nwhile in others the ground colour is much lighter and the darker\\r\\nmarkings are more inclined to red, and to form a zone round the larger\\r\\nend; the eggs are generally three in number, one inch and three lines\\r\\nlong by eleven lines broad.\\r\\n\\r\\nUnder ordinary circumstances this species is very shy and retiring, but\\r\\nat times is altogether as bold; as an evidence of which I may mention,\\r\\nthat having caught a young _Eöpsaltria_ and placed it in my pocket, the\\r\\ncries of the little captive attracted the attention of one of these\\r\\nbirds, which continued to follow me through the woods for more than an\\r\\nhour, when the little tenant, disliking its close quarters, effected its\\r\\nescape and flitted away before me: I immediately gave chase; but the\\r\\nButcher-bird, who had been following me, pounced down within two yards\\r\\nof my face and bore off the poor bird to a neighbouring tree, and\\r\\nalthough I ran to the rescue, it was of no avail, the prize being borne\\r\\naway from tree to tree until the tyrant paid the forfeit of his life by\\r\\nbeing shot for his temerity.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sexes are so similar in appearance, that it is impossible to\\r\\ndistinguish one from the other by any other means than dissection.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe male has the crown of the head, ear-coverts and back of the neck\\r\\nblack; a white mark from the base of the bill to the eye; back and rump\\r\\ndark greyish brown; upper tail-coverts white; wings blackish brown; the\\r\\nmiddle secondaries white along their outer edges; tail black, all the\\r\\nfeathers except the two middle ones tipped with white on their inner\\r\\nwebs; under surface greyish white; bill bluish lead-colour at the base,\\r\\npassing into black at the tip; feet blackish lead-colour; irides very\\r\\ndark reddish brown.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe female resembles the male, but is more obscure in all her markings;\\r\\nand the young differ in being clothed in a plumage of mottled tawny and\\r\\nbrown.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe figures represent the two sexes of the natural size.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration:\\r\\n\\r\\n  CRACTICUS QUOYII.\\r\\n\\r\\n  _J.

In some instances the\\r\\nsame species are found to inhabit both countries, and of this fact the\\r\\npresent bird is an example. M. Temminck, to whom I showed specimens\\r\\nkilled in Australia, assured me that they were identical with those from\\r\\nNew Guinea. The northern coast is the only portion of Australia in which\\r\\nthis bird has been observed. It is tolerably abundant at Port Essington,\\r\\nwhere it inhabits the mangrove swamps generally, even those close to the\\r\\nsettlement.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Gilbert states that it is one of the most shy and wary birds that\\r\\ncan well be imagined; and that the nature of its usual haunts precludes\\r\\nin a great measure all chance of getting a sight of it. He has never met\\r\\nwith it in any other situation than the darkest and thickest parts of\\r\\nthe mangroves, where there is a great depth of mud, and where the roots\\r\\nof the trees are very thickly intertwined; it is among these roots that\\r\\nit is constantly seen searching for crabs. Its note is short and\\r\\nmonotonous, and very like the name given to it by the aborigines,\\r\\n_Mol-göl-ga_, the second syllable being prolonged and forming the\\r\\nhighest note; it also utters other sounds, some of them resembling those\\r\\nof the _Cracticus leuconotus_; at other times it frequently emits a note\\r\\nvery similar to the cry of young birds for food.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe stomach is muscular, and the food consists of crabs, and\\r\\noccasionally of coleoptera, neuroptera, and the larvæ of insects of\\r\\nvarious kinds.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe entire plumage black, each feather of the upper and under surface\\r\\nbroadly margined with deep glossy green; irides dark reddish brown; bill\\r\\nvery light ash-grey, passing into leaden grey at the base, and dark\\r\\nbluish grey on the culmen near the tip; legs and feet greenish grey.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe bill appears to vary very much in colour; being in some instances\\r\\nentirely ash-grey, except at the tip, where it is black; while in others\\r\\nthe basal two-thirds is black and the tip grey: whether this difference\\r\\nis occasioned by age or sex has not yet been ascertained.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe figure represents a male of the natural size.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration:\\r\\n\\r\\n  GRALLINA AUSTRALIS.\\r\\n\\r\\n  _J.

I\\r\\nbelieve it feeds solely upon insects of various kinds, particularly\\r\\naquatic grubs, grasshoppers, and coleoptera generally.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe flight of the _Grallina_ is very peculiar, and unlike that of any\\r\\nother Australian bird that has come under my notice; it much resembles\\r\\nthat of the Common Pewit of Europe, and is performed with the same heavy\\r\\nflapping motion of the wings; still the flight of the two birds differs\\r\\nmaterially during their passage through the air, the _Grallina_ passing\\r\\nnoiselessly and generally in a straight line, while the Pewit makes\\r\\nsudden turns and dips,—a peculiarity in its mode of flight which must\\r\\nhave been noticed by all who have seen the bird on the wing.\\r\\n\\r\\nIts natural note is a peculiarly shrill whining whistle often repeated.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe nest may be regarded as one of the anomalies of Australia, so unlike\\r\\nis it to anything usually met with; it is from five to six inches in\\r\\nbreadth and three in depth, and is formed of soft mud, which soon\\r\\nbecoming hard and solid upon exposure to the atmosphere has precisely\\r\\nthe appearance of a massive clay-coloured earthenware vessel; as if to\\r\\nattract notice, this singular structure is generally placed on some bare\\r\\nhorizontal branch, often on the one most exposed to view, sometimes\\r\\noverhanging water and at others in the open forest. The colour of the\\r\\nnest varies with that of the material of which it is formed: sometimes\\r\\nthe clay or mud is sufficiently tenacious to be used without any other\\r\\nmaterial, but in those situations where no mud or clay is to be obtained\\r\\nit is constructed of black or brown mould; the bird, appearing to be\\r\\naware that this substance will not hold together for want of the\\r\\nadhesive quality of the clay, mixes with it a great quantity of dried\\r\\ngrass, stalks, &c., and thus forms a firm and hard exterior, the inside\\r\\nof which is slightly lined with dried grasses and a few feathers. The\\r\\neggs differ considerably in colour and in shape, some being extremely\\r\\nlengthened, while others bear a relative proportion; the ground-colour\\r\\nof some is a beautiful pearl-white, of others a slight tinge of buff;\\r\\ntheir markings again differ considerably in form and in their\\r\\ndisposition, being in some instances wholly confined to the larger end,\\r\\nin others distributed over the whole of the surface, but always inclined\\r\\nto form a zone at the larger end; in some these markings are of a deep\\r\\nchestnut-red, in others light red with large clouded spots of grey\\r\\nappearing as if beneath the surface of the shell. The eggs are generally\\r\\nfour, but sometimes are only two in number; their medium length is one\\r\\ninch and three lines, and their breadth nine lines. It breeds in October\\r\\nand November.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough the sexes are very similar in size, the female may at all times\\r\\nbe distinguished from the male by her white forehead and throat, a fact\\r\\nI determined many times by actual dissection, thus showing the fallacy\\r\\nof the opinion entertained by some naturalists of their being two\\r\\ndistinct species.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe male has a line over the eye, a patch on each side of the neck, a\\r\\nlongitudinal stripe on the wing, tips of the secondaries, rump, upper\\r\\ntail-coverts, the basal two-thirds and the tips of the tail, under\\r\\nsurface of the shoulder, breast, flanks, abdomen and under tail-coverts\\r\\nwhite, the remainder of the plumage black with a deep bluish tinge on\\r\\nthe head, throat, chest and back, and a green tinge on the primaries and\\r\\ntail; bill yellowish white; irides straw-yellow; feet black.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe female differs in having the forehead, lores and chin white. The\\r\\nyoung on leaving the nest have the irides black; in other respects they\\r\\nresemble their parents, but are of course far less brilliant in colour.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe figures represent the two sexes of the natural size.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration:\\r\\n\\r\\n  GRAUCALUS MELANOPS.\\r\\n\\r\\n  _J.

On the plains of the interior, such as the Liverpool and\\r\\nthose which stretch away to the northward and eastward of New South\\r\\nWales, it is more abundant than within the colony.\\r\\n\\r\\nIts flight is undulating and powerful, but is seldom exerted for any\\r\\nother purpose than that of conveying it from one part of the forest to\\r\\nanother, or to sally forth in pursuit of an insect which may pass within\\r\\nrange of its vision while perched upon some dead branch of a high tree,\\r\\na habit common to this bird and the other members of the genus. On this\\r\\nelevated perch it sometimes remains for hours together; but during the\\r\\nheat of the day seeks shelter from the rays of the sun by shrouding\\r\\nitself amidst the dense foliage of the trees. Its food consists of\\r\\ninsects and their larvæ, and berries, but the former appear to be\\r\\npreferred, all kinds being acceptable, from the large Mantis figured in\\r\\nthe accompanying Plate, to others of a minute size. One of the specimens\\r\\nI procured was shot while in the act of flying off with the insect\\r\\nfigured.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs much diversity occurs in the colouring of the face and throat of this\\r\\nspecies before it arrives at maturity, I made a point of minutely\\r\\ninvestigating the subject during my stay in New South Wales, and the\\r\\nfollowing is the result of my observations. When the young, which are\\r\\ngenerally two in number, leave the nest, the feathers of the body are\\r\\nbrown, margined with light grey; this colouring is soon exchanged for\\r\\none of a uniform grey, except on the lower part of the abdomen and under\\r\\ntail-coverts, which are white, and a mark of black which surrounds the\\r\\neye and spreads over the ears: the throat and forehead in this stage are\\r\\nlighter than the remainder of the plumage, which is somewhat singular,\\r\\nas in the next change that takes place those parts become of a\\r\\njet-black; and this colour, I believe, is never afterwards thrown off,\\r\\nbut remains a characteristic of the adult state of both sexes, which are\\r\\nat all times so similar in size and colour as not to be distinguished\\r\\nfrom each other.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt breeds in October and the three following months. The nest is often\\r\\nof a triangular form, in consequence of its being made to fit the angle\\r\\nof the fork of the horizontal branch in which it is placed; it is\\r\\nentirely composed of small dead twigs, firmly matted together with a\\r\\nvery fine, white, downy substance like cobwebs and a species of\\r\\n_Lichen_, giving the nest the same appearance as the branch upon which\\r\\nit is placed, and rendering it most difficult of detection. In some\\r\\ninstances I have found the nest ornamented with the broad, white,\\r\\nmouse-eared Lichen; it is extremely shallow in form, its depth and\\r\\nbreadth depending entirely upon that of the fork in which it is built;\\r\\nthe largest I have seen did not exceed six inches in diameter.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ground-colour of the eggs, which are almost invariably two in\\r\\nnumber, varies from wood-brown to asparagus-green, the blotches and\\r\\nspots, which are very generally dispersed over their surface, varying\\r\\nfrom dull chestnut-brown to light yellowish brown; in some instances\\r\\nthey are also sparingly dotted with deep umber-brown; their medium\\r\\nlength is thirteen lines, and breadth ten lines.\\r\\n\\r\\nIts note, which is seldom uttered, is a peculiar single purring or\\r\\njarring sound, repeated several times in succession.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe adults have the forehead, sides of the face, ear-coverts and throat\\r\\njet-black; crown of the head, all the upper surface and wing-coverts\\r\\ndelicate grey; primaries black, their outer edges and tips margined with\\r\\ngrey; secondaries grey, with their inner webs black; tail grey at the\\r\\nbase, gradually passing into black near the extremity, and broadly\\r\\ntipped with white; chest blackish grey, into which the black of the\\r\\nthroat gradually passes; lower part of the abdomen pale grey; under\\r\\ntail-coverts white; irides, bill and feet black.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Plate represents an adult male and a young bird of the first year of\\r\\nthe natural size.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration:\\r\\n\\r\\n  GRAUCALUS MENTALIS: _Vig. & Horsf._\\r\\n\\r\\n  _J.

In extreme youth, or\\r\\nduring the first few months after it has left the nest, the throat,\\r\\nchest and back of the neck is jet-black, while the breast and abdomen\\r\\nare rayed with obscure arrow-shaped markings of the same colour on a\\r\\ngreyish white ground; from this state individuals in every variety of\\r\\nchange, to the uniform grey throat and head, with black lores and mark\\r\\nunder the eye, are to be met with. Independently of a difference in its\\r\\nmarkings, its much smaller size will at all times serve to distinguish\\r\\nit from _Graucalus melanops_, which inhabits the same districts. Insects\\r\\nof various orders and caterpillars, which are either captured on the\\r\\nwing or taken from the branches, form its diet.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the adult the upper surface and wings are dark slate-grey, passing\\r\\ninto paler grey on the forehead and on the rump and upper tail-coverts;\\r\\nprimaries and secondaries slaty black, narrowly edged with greyish\\r\\nwhite; outer webs of the three secondaries nearest the body grey; tail\\r\\nblack, the lateral feathers largely tipped with white; lores deep\\r\\nvelvety black, which colour is continued above and below the eye; throat\\r\\nand breast grey; insertion of the wing, under surface of the wing,\\r\\nabdomen and under tail-coverts white; bill black; irides and feet dark\\r\\nbrown.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the accompanying Plate I have figured the extremes of colouring\\r\\nassumed by the bird; the darkest-coloured being the young of the year.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration:\\r\\n\\r\\n  GRAUCALUS HYPOLEUCUS: _Gould_.\\r\\n\\r\\n  _J.

It is abundant in every\\r\\npart of the Cobourg Peninsula, and is generally seen in small families\\r\\nof from four to ten or twelve in number.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe whiteness of the under surface serves to distinguish this from all\\r\\nthe other species of the genus yet discovered in Australia.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe stomach is muscular, and the food consists of insects of various\\r\\ngenera, which are generally taken from off the leafy branches of the\\r\\nhighest trees.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sexes assimilate very closely in colouring, and only differ in the\\r\\nfemales and young males having the lores of a dull brown instead of\\r\\nblack.\\r\\n\\r\\nLores black; crown of the head and all the upper surface dark grey;\\r\\nwings and tail black; chin, under surface of the wings, abdomen and\\r\\nunder tail-coverts white; breast pale greyish white; irides brownish\\r\\nblack; bill blackish brown; legs and feet black; insides of the feet and\\r\\nspaces between the scales of the tarsi mealy grey.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe figures are of the natural size.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration:\\r\\n\\r\\n  GRAUCALUS SWAINSONII: _Gould_.\\r\\n\\r\\n  _J.

Judging from the specimens I\\r\\nhave examined, I believe that the sexes are alike in plumage.\\r\\n\\r\\nLores black; head, all the upper surface, wing-coverts, throat and\\r\\nbreast grey; primaries and secondaries black; the former narrowly, and\\r\\nthe latter broadly margined on their external edges with grey; tail grey\\r\\nat the base, black for the remainder of its length; abdomen, under\\r\\nsurface of the shoulder, and under tail-coverts white, crossed by\\r\\nnumerous decided narrow bars of black; bill and feet black.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe figures are of the natural size.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration:\\r\\n\\r\\n  PTEROPODOCYS PHASIANELLUS: _Gould_.\\r\\n\\r\\n  _J.

The\\r\\nlengthened form of the tarsi and tail and the narrow form of the bill\\r\\nare the most striking of the structural differences between\\r\\n_Pteropodocys_ and _Graucalus_, and are so apparent that they must be\\r\\nperceptible at a single glance to all who will examine them. Plains and\\r\\nopen glades skirted by belts of high trees are the localities in which I\\r\\ngenerally met with this bird either in pairs or small parties of four or\\r\\nfive; in the latter case they were probably the brood of the year, as\\r\\nthey usually consisted of both immature and adult birds.\\r\\n\\r\\nIts powers of progression on the ground are considerable, and are only\\r\\nequalled by those of flight; when disturbed it flies across the plain to\\r\\nthe belts of lofty trees, among the branches of which it appears to be\\r\\nquite as much at ease as upon the ground. During flight the white mark\\r\\non the rump is very conspicuous, and may be seen at a considerable\\r\\ndistance.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe food consists of insects and seeds of various kinds.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat its range extends over the whole of the interior of Australia is\\r\\nmore than probable, as I have lately received a specimen from Swan\\r\\nRiver, in which part of the country it doubtless inhabits localities\\r\\nsimilar to those it frequents on the east coast.\\r\\n\\r\\nOf its nidification I regret to say nothing is at present known.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sexes, which exhibit no external differences, may be thus\\r\\ndescribed:—\\r\\n\\r\\nHead, neck, chest and back delicate grey, becoming darker on the\\r\\near-coverts; rump and abdomen white, crossed by narrow irregular bars of\\r\\nblack; under tail-coverts white; wings and tail black, the latter having\\r\\nthe tips of the outer and the basal portion of all the feathers white;\\r\\nbill and feet black, tinged with olive; irides butty white.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe figures are of the natural size.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration:\\r\\n\\r\\n  CAMPEPHAGA JARDINII.\\r\\n\\r\\n  _J.

The great\\r\\ndifference in the colouring of the sexes, its smaller size and more\\r\\nattenuated bill, point out most clearly that it is a member of the genus\\r\\n_Campephaga_, and not of _Graucalus_, to which it was first assigned. It\\r\\nis far less common in New South Wales than it is at Port Essington,\\r\\nwhere Mr. Gilbert collected the following notes respecting it:—\\r\\n\\r\\n“This bird is extremely shy and retiring in its habits. I have never\\r\\nseen it flying about the low shrubs like the other species of the genus,\\r\\nnor at any time near the ground; on the contrary, it always inhabits the\\r\\ntopmost branches of the loftiest and most thickly-foliaged trees growing\\r\\nin the immediate vicinity of swamps, or the mangroves. Its note too is\\r\\naltogether different from that of any other species of the genus, being\\r\\na harsh, grating, buzzing tone, repeated rather rapidly about a dozen\\r\\ntimes in succession, followed by a lengthened interval. It appears to be\\r\\na solitary species, as I never saw more than one at a time.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe stomach is muscular, and the food consists of insects of all kinds,\\r\\nbut principally coleoptera.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe adult male has the lores black; all the upper and under surface,\\r\\nwing-coverts, edges of the primaries and secondaries, basal\\r\\nthree-fourths of the two central and the tips of the outer tail-feathers\\r\\ndeep blue-grey; primaries, secondaries and the other parts of the tail\\r\\nblack; irides dark brown; bill blackish brown; legs and feet very dark\\r\\ngreenish grey.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe female has the whole of the upper surface, wings and tail brown, the\\r\\ntwo latter edged with buff; line over the eye and all the under surface\\r\\nbuff, the feathers of the side of the neck, the breast and the flanks\\r\\nwith an arrow-head-shaped mark of brown in the centre.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe young male is bluish brown above; wings and tail as in the female;\\r\\nunder surface buff, crossed with numerous transverse narrow irregular\\r\\nbars of black.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe figures represent an adult and a young male of the natural size.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration:\\r\\n\\r\\n  CAMPEPHAGA KARU.\\r\\n\\r\\n  _J.

Traité d’Orn., p. 374.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Gilbert, who met with this species at Port Essington on the northern\\r\\ncoast of Australia, states that it is a very shy and timid bird, that it\\r\\nis generally seen creeping about in pairs among the thickets and clumps\\r\\nof mangroves, that its note is a somewhat shrill piping call, that its\\r\\nstomach is tolerably muscular, and that it feeds upon insects of various\\r\\nkinds: this, I regret to say, is all that is known respecting it.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn referring this species to the _Lanius Karu_ of Lesson, I am rather\\r\\ninfluenced by a desire not to add to the number of useless synonyms,\\r\\nthan from any positive conviction of their being identical; for\\r\\nalthough, having only M. Lesson’s figure to refer to, I am unable to\\r\\ndetect any difference of sufficient importance to be considered\\r\\nspecific, little doubt exists in my mind that the two birds are really\\r\\ndistinct, and that future research will verify the propriety of this\\r\\nopinion.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe male has the head, all the upper surface, wings and tail black; the\\r\\nwing-coverts largely tipped, primaries narrowly edged and tipped,\\r\\nsecondaries broadly margined on their external webs, rump and upper\\r\\ntail-coverts slightly, the external tail-feather largely, and the next\\r\\non each side slightly tipped with white; line from the nostrils over\\r\\neach eye to the occiput buffy white; under surface pale grey, crossed on\\r\\nthe breast and flanks with narrow irregular bars of slaty black, and\\r\\nwashed with fulvous, gradually increasing in intensity until on the vent\\r\\nand under tail-coverts it becomes of a deep tawny buff; irides dark\\r\\nbrown; bill black; feet blackish grey externally, bluish grey\\r\\ninternally; light mealy ashy grey between the scales and inside the\\r\\nfeet.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe female differs in being somewhat smaller than the male; in having\\r\\nthe upper surface and tail brown, instead of black; the upper\\r\\ntail-coverts tipped with buff instead of white, and the barrings of the\\r\\nunder surface broader, darker and more distinct.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Plate represents the two sexes of the natural size.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration:\\r\\n\\r\\n  CAMPEPHAGA LEUCOMELA: _Vig. & Horsf._\\r\\n\\r\\n  _J.

I have had examples of this species in my\\r\\ncollection for many years, but was not fortunate enough to see it alive\\r\\nduring my visit to Australia. Mr. Strange has also sent me a pair which\\r\\nhe had shot in the scrubs on the banks of the Clarence. Its nest and\\r\\neggs, and any information of its habits, are desiderata to me.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sexes, as in the other species, differ considerably from each other;\\r\\nthey may be thus described:—\\r\\n\\r\\nThe male has the head, back, wings and tail deep glossy black;\\r\\nwing-coverts largely tipped and the secondaries broadly margined with\\r\\nwhite; the two outer tail-feathers tipped with white, the external one\\r\\nalso narrowly margined on the outer web with the same hue; rump and\\r\\nupper tail-coverts very dark grey; line over the eye snow-white; under\\r\\nsurface greyish white, gradually passing into rufous on the abdomen and\\r\\nunder tail-coverts, and indistinctly rayed with dark grey; bill, feet\\r\\nand irides black.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe young male is brown where the male is black; has the wings not so\\r\\nconspicuously marked with white; the under surface washed with rufous\\r\\nand conspicuously rayed with brown; and the under tail-coverts deep\\r\\nrufous.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe figures represent an adult male and young male of the natural size.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration:\\r\\n\\r\\n  CAMPEPHAGA HUMERALIS: _Gould_.\\r\\n\\r\\n  _J.

Birds of Australia, Part IV.\\r\\n\\r\\n  _Goö-mul-cül-long_, Aborigines of the mountain districts of Western\\r\\n            Australia.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThis bird occurs in considerable numbers throughout the whole of the\\r\\nsouthern portion of Australia during the months of summer; it is\\r\\nstrictly migratory, arriving in the month of September, when insects are\\r\\nmost plentiful, and having performed the task of reproduction departs\\r\\nagain northwards in the months of January and February. It is a most\\r\\nanimated, lively and spirited bird, constantly singing a loud and pretty\\r\\nsong while actively engaged in pursuit of insects, which it either\\r\\ncaptures on the wing, among the branches or on the ground. It commences\\r\\nbreeding soon after its arrival, constructing a shallow round nest of\\r\\nsmall pieces of bark, short dead twigs and grasses interwoven with fine\\r\\nvegetable fibres, cobwebs, white moss, &c., and sometimes a few grasses\\r\\nand fine fibrous roots by way of lining; it is usually placed in the\\r\\nfork of a horizontal dead branch of the apple- and gum-trees, and is not\\r\\neasily seen from below. During the early part of the breeding-season the\\r\\nmale frequently chases the female from tree to tree, pouring forth his\\r\\nsong all the while. The eggs, which are generally two, but sometimes\\r\\nthree in number, differ very considerably in colour, some being of a\\r\\nlight green blotched all over with wood-brown, while others have a\\r\\nlighter ground so largely blotched with chestnut-brown as nearly to\\r\\ncover the entire surface of the shell, and I have seen some of an almost\\r\\nuniform greyish green; their medium length is nine and a half lines and\\r\\nbreadth seven and a half lines.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe above is a detail of what I myself observed of the bird in New South\\r\\nWales. In his Notes from Western Australia, Mr. Gilbert says, “This bird\\r\\nis a migratory summer visitant to this part of the country, where it\\r\\narrives about the beginning of September, after which it is to be met\\r\\nwith in considerable numbers among the mountains of the interior, but is\\r\\nvery rarely seen in the lowland districts.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Its powers of flight are considerable, and when excited during the\\r\\nbreeding-season the males become very pugnacious, and not only attack\\r\\neach other in the most desperate manner, but also assault much larger\\r\\nbirds that may approach the nest. Its usual flight is even, steady and\\r\\ngraceful, and while flying from tree to tree it gives utterance to its\\r\\nsweet and agreeable song, which at times is so like the full, swelling,\\r\\nshaking note of the Canary, that it might easily be mistaken for the\\r\\nsong of that bird. It is a remarkably shy bird, especially the females,\\r\\nwhich are so seldom seen that I was at first inclined to think they were\\r\\nmuch less numerous than the other sex, but this I afterwards found was\\r\\nnot the case; their favourite haunts are thickly wooded places and the\\r\\nmost secluded spots. The nest is so diminutive that it is very difficult\\r\\nto detect it, and so shallow in form that it is quite surprising the\\r\\neggs do not roll out when the branch is shaken by the wind. I am told\\r\\nthat they generally build in the Raspberry-Jam-tree, but the nests I\\r\\ndiscovered were placed on a horizontal dead branch of a Eucalyptus; they\\r\\nwere formed of grasses and contained two eggs. It breeds in the latter\\r\\npart of September and the beginning of October.” Mr. Gilbert\\r\\nsubsequently met with the bird at Port Essington, where also it appears\\r\\nto be migratory, for not a single individual was to be seen from the\\r\\nearly part of November to the month of March; females and young birds\\r\\nwere very abundant on his arrival in July, but he only met with one old\\r\\nmale during his residence in the colony, a period of eight months.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe stomach is muscular, and the food consists of insects of various\\r\\nkinds and their larvæ.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sexes differ considerably in colour, as will be seen in the\\r\\naccompanying Plate and the following description:—\\r\\n\\r\\nThe male has the forehead, crown of the head, back of the neck and upper\\r\\npart of the back glossy greenish black; shoulders and upper wing-coverts\\r\\npure white, forming an oblique line along the wing; the remainder of the\\r\\nwing dull black, with the secondaries slightly margined and tipped with\\r\\nwhite; lower part of the back and rump grey; tail dull black, the two\\r\\nouter feathers on each side largely tipped with white; throat, chest and\\r\\nall the under surface white; bill and feet black; irides nearly black.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe female has all the upper surface, wings and tail brown; wing-coverts\\r\\nand secondaries margined with buff; throat and all the under surface\\r\\nbuffy white, with the sides and front of the breast speckled with brown;\\r\\nirides very dark brown; upper mandible and tip of the lower dark reddish\\r\\nbrown; basal portion of the latter saffron-yellow; legs and feet dark\\r\\ngreyish black, slightly tinged with lead-colour.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe figures represent the two sexes of the size of life.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration:\\r\\n\\r\\n  PACHYCEPHALA GUTTURALIS.\\r\\n\\r\\n  _J.

It is\\r\\nrather abundantly dispersed over the forests of _Eucalypti_ and the\\r\\nbelts of _Acaciæ_, among the flowering branches of which latter tribe of\\r\\ntrees the male displays himself to the greatest advantage, and shows off\\r\\nhis rich yellow breast as if desirous of outvieing the beautiful\\r\\nblossoms with which he is surrounded.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe stomach is very muscular, and its principal food consists of insects\\r\\nof various genera, which are sought for and captured both among the\\r\\nflowers and leaves as well as on the ground.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is generally met with in pairs, but the males are more shy than the\\r\\nfemales. It flies in short and sudden starts, and seldom mounts far\\r\\nabove the tops of the trees.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe voice of the male is a single note seven or eight times repeated,\\r\\nand terminating with a sharp higher note much resembling the smack of a\\r\\nwhip; that of the female is very different, being a series of running\\r\\nhalf-notes, forming a rather plaintive tune.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Gilbert mentions that it is sparingly dispersed throughout the Swan\\r\\nRiver colony, but is more abundant in the best-watered districts, such\\r\\nas Perth and Fremantle.\\r\\n\\r\\nI did not succeed in finding the nest of this species, but was informed\\r\\nthat it breeds in September and October, and lays three or four eggs,\\r\\nten and a half lines long by eight lines broad, with a ground-colour of\\r\\nbrownish buff, sparingly streaked and spotted with reddish brown and\\r\\nbluish grey, the latter colour appearing as if beneath the surface of\\r\\nthe shell.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe male has the crown of the head, lores, line beneath the eye,\\r\\near-coverts, and a crescent-shaped mark from the latter across the\\r\\nbreast deep black; throat, within the black, white; back of the neck, a\\r\\nnarrow line down each side of the chest behind the black crescent, and\\r\\nall the under surface gamboge-yellow; back and upper tail-coverts\\r\\nyellowish olive; wing-coverts blackish brown, margined with yellowish\\r\\nolive; primaries and secondaries blackish brown, margined with greyish\\r\\nolive; basal half of the tail grey, apical half blackish brown tipped\\r\\nwith grey; irides dark brown; bill black; legs and feet blackish grey.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe female has the whole of the upper surface and tail greyish brown;\\r\\nprimaries and secondaries brown, margined with grey; throat pale brown\\r\\nfreckled with white; remainder of the under surface pale brown, passing\\r\\ninto deep buff on the abdomen.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Plate represents the two sexes of the natural size.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration:\\r\\n\\r\\n  PACHYCEPHALA GLAUCURA: _Gould_.\\r\\n\\r\\n  _J.

Van Diemen’s Land and the islands in Bass’s Straits are the\\r\\nonly countries in which it has yet been discovered, and where it takes\\r\\nthe place of the _P. gutturalis_, which latter species appears to be\\r\\nexclusively confined to the Australian continent.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe _P. glaucura_ frequents the vast forests of _Eucalypti_ that cover\\r\\nthe greater part of Van Diemen’s Land, and although it is rather thinly\\r\\ndispersed, is to be met with in every variety of situation, the crowns\\r\\nof the hills and the deep and most secluded gulleys being alike visited\\r\\nby it. It frequently descends to the ground in search of insects, but\\r\\nthe leafy branches of the trees, particularly those of a low growth, are\\r\\nthe situations to which it gives the preference.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe adult male, like most other birds of attractive plumage, is of a shy\\r\\ndisposition; hence there is much more difficulty in obtaining a glimpse\\r\\nof it in the woods, than of the sombre-coloured and comparatively tame\\r\\nfemale, or even of the young males of the year, which during this period\\r\\nwear a similar kind of livery to that of the latter.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe actions of this species are somewhat peculiar, and unlike those of\\r\\nmost other insectivorous birds: it pries about the leafy branches of the\\r\\ntrees, and leaps from twig to twig in the most agile manner possible,\\r\\nmaking all the while a most scrutinizing search for insects,\\r\\nparticularly coleoptera. When the male exposes himself, as he\\r\\noccasionally does, on some bare twig, the rich yellow of his plumage,\\r\\noffering a strong contrast to the green of the surrounding foliage,\\r\\nrenders him a conspicuous and doubtless highly attractive object to his\\r\\nsombre-coloured mate, who generally accompanies him. Males in colour\\r\\nlike those represented on the accompanying Plate seldom associate\\r\\ntogether, their recluse disposition leading them not only to avoid each\\r\\nother’s society, but also that of all other birds. It sometimes resorts\\r\\nto the gardens and shrubberies of the settlers, but much less frequently\\r\\nthan might be supposed, when we consider that the neighbouring forests\\r\\nare its natural place of abode.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe voice of the Grey-tailed Pachycephala is a loud whistling call of a\\r\\nsingle note several times repeated, and by which the presence of the\\r\\nmale is often detected when it would otherwise be passed by unnoticed. I\\r\\nwas unsuccessful in my search for its nest, and the eggs are still a\\r\\ndesideratum to my cabinet. I shot the young in various stages of\\r\\nplumage, and found them to differ so much that a more, than ordinarily\\r\\nminute description is necessary, in order that those who may not have an\\r\\nopportunity of seeing the bird in its native country may not be misled\\r\\nrespecting it. Soon after leaving the nest the ground-colour of the\\r\\nentire plumage is grey, washed or stained as it were, both on the upper\\r\\nand under surface, with rusty or chestnut-red; this gradually gives\\r\\nplace to a uniform olive-brown above and pale brown beneath, which being\\r\\nprecisely the colouring of the adult females, the young birds in this\\r\\nstage and the old females are not to be distinguished from each other.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe adult male has the crown of the head, lores, space beneath the eye\\r\\nand a broad crescent-shaped mark from the latter across the breast deep\\r\\nblack; throat, within the black, white; back of the neck, a narrow line\\r\\ndown each side of the chest behind the black crescent and the under\\r\\nsurface yellow; back and wing-coverts yellowish olive; wings dark\\r\\nslate-colour margined with grey; tail entirely grey; under tail-coverts\\r\\nwhite, or very slightly washed with yellow; irides reddish brown; bill\\r\\nblack; feet dark brown.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Plate represents two males and a female of the natural size, on one\\r\\nof the common Acacias of Van Diemen’s Land.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration:\\r\\n\\r\\n  PACHYCEPHALA MELANURA: _Gould_.\\r\\n\\r\\n  _J.

Bynoe, Esq., during the surveying\\r\\nvoyage of H.M.S. the Beagle. It may be readily distinguished from the\\r\\n_P. gutturalis_ and _P. glaucura_ by the jet-black colouring of the\\r\\ntail, which organ is also shorter and more square than that of any other\\r\\nspecies, by its much longer bill, and by the colouring of the back of\\r\\nthe neck and the under surface being richer than that of either of those\\r\\nabove-named. I have not yet seen a female of this fine species, wanting\\r\\nwhich I have figured two males in different positions.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt may be thus described:—\\r\\n\\r\\nHead, crescent commencing behind the eye and crossing the chest and the\\r\\ntail black; throat pure white; collar round the back and sides of the\\r\\nneck, and all the under surface very rich gamboge-yellow; upper surface\\r\\nrich yellowish olive; wings black, the coverts margined with yellowish\\r\\nolive; the primaries narrowly and the secondaries broadly margined with\\r\\nyellowish grey; bill and feet black; irides brown.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe figures are of the natural size.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration:\\r\\n\\r\\n  PACHYCEPHALA PECTORALIS: (_Vig. & Horsf._)\\r\\n\\r\\n  _Drawn from Nature & on Stone by J. & E.

During the spring and the earlier months of summer\\r\\nthere are few birds that possess a more animated and lively song, which,\\r\\nmoreover, is very different from any bird I recollect having heard,\\r\\neither in Australia or Europe, being a loud continuous ringing whistle,\\r\\nfrequently terminating in a sharp smack, this latter note being peculiar\\r\\nto most members of the group. In New South Wales and South Australia it\\r\\nis abundantly dispersed over all the thinly-timbered forests, keeping\\r\\namong the leafy branches of the highest trees. I do not myself recollect\\r\\nhaving met with it in the brushes, while in Western Australia the thick\\r\\nscrubs are said to be its favourite places of resort.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough it does not migrate it makes a slight change in the situations\\r\\nit frequents, according to the state of the seasons, or the more or less\\r\\nabundant supply of food, which consists of insects of various kinds,\\r\\ncaterpillars and berries: like the other members of the group, it creeps\\r\\nand hops about the branches in a gentle and quiet manner.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sexes, as will be seen in the accompanying illustration, differ very\\r\\nconsiderably both in the arrangement of their markings and in the\\r\\ngeneral colouring of their plumage, and it is not until the second year\\r\\nthat the young males assume the band on the chest and the pure white\\r\\nthroat of the adult. The breeding-season commences in August or\\r\\nSeptember, and continues during the three following months. The nest is\\r\\ncup-shaped, and rather a frail structure, being often so slight that the\\r\\neggs may be descried through the interstices of the fine twigs and\\r\\nfibrous roots of which it is composed. In New South Wales I found the\\r\\nnest is built upon the small horizontal branches of large trees, but at\\r\\nSwan River it is more frequently constructed in shrubs, particularly the\\r\\n_Melaleuca_: the eggs are generally three in number, of an olive tint,\\r\\nwith a zone of indistinct spots and blotches at the larger end; they are\\r\\neleven lines long by eight lines broad.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe male has the throat white, encircled by a broad band of black, which\\r\\ncommences at the base of the bill, surrounds the eye, passes down the\\r\\nsides of the neck, and crosses the breast; forehead and crown dark grey,\\r\\nwith a small stripe of black down the centre of each feather; the\\r\\nremainder of the upper surface dark grey; wings and tail blackish brown,\\r\\neach feather margined on the outer web with dark grey; sides of the\\r\\nbreast and flanks grey; centre of the breast, abdomen, and under\\r\\ntail-coverts orange-brown; irides reddish hazel; bill black; legs and\\r\\nfeet olive-black.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe female has the head and all the upper surface brownish grey; wings\\r\\nand tail dark brown, margined on the exterior webs with brownish grey;\\r\\nthroat dull white, gradually passing into the tawny buff which covers\\r\\nthe whole of the under surface, each feather of the throat and under\\r\\nsurface having a narrow stripe of dark brown down the centre; irides\\r\\nblackish brown; bill flesh-brown; corner of the mouth yellow; feet\\r\\nlead-colour.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Plate represents a male and a female of the natural size.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration:\\r\\n\\r\\n  PACHYCEPHALA FALCATA: _Gould_.\\r\\n\\r\\n  _J.

All the specimens I possess were killed on the Cobourg\\r\\nPeninsula, near the settlement at Port Essington, where, as well as on\\r\\nthe adjacent islands, it is a stationary species, and very abundant. It\\r\\nbreeds in September and the two following months, and lays two eggs. Its\\r\\nhabits and manners are precisely similar to those of the other members\\r\\nof the family.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe adult male has the crown of the head, lores, ear-coverts, back and\\r\\nupper tail-coverts grey; wings dark brown, all the feathers margined\\r\\nwith grey; throat white, bounded below by a distinct crescent of black;\\r\\nabdomen, flanks and under tail-coverts orange-brown; tail dark brown,\\r\\nthe basal portion of the webs edged with grey; irides reddish brown;\\r\\nbill black; feet blackish brown.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe adult female has the crown of the head and all the upper surface\\r\\ngrey; ear-coverts brownish grey; throat buffy white, passing into light\\r\\nbuff or fawn-colour on the chest, flanks, abdomen and under\\r\\ntail-coverts; the feathers of the throat and chest with a narrow dark\\r\\nline down the centre; wings and tail as in the male.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe young male is similar in colour to the female, but has the throat\\r\\nwhiter and the markings on the chest much more distinct, and extending\\r\\nover the abdomen also.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn very young individuals a rich rufous or tawny tint pervades the\\r\\ngreater part of the upper surface.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe figures represent the two sexes of the natural size.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration:\\r\\n\\r\\n  PACHYCEPHALA LANOÏDES: _Gould_.\\r\\n\\r\\n  _J.

On\\r\\nreference to the figure on the Plate, it will be seen that it is a most\\r\\nrobust and powerful species, and that it so closely approximates to the\\r\\nform of the genus _Lanius_, that had it been a native of any other\\r\\ncountry than Australia, where the true Shrikes are not found, it might\\r\\nhave been referred to that genus.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat it feeds on insects of a large size there can be but little doubt,\\r\\nits whole structure indicating that it exists upon this kind of food.\\r\\n\\r\\nNo information whatever has been obtained with respect to its habits and\\r\\neconomy; this blank therefore remains to be filled up by those\\r\\nnaturalists who may hereafter visit the part of the country of which it\\r\\nis a denizen.\\r\\n\\r\\nCrown of the head, ear-coverts and chest black, bounded posteriorly by a\\r\\nnarrow band of chestnut; throat, centre of the abdomen and under\\r\\ntail-coverts white; flanks, back, shoulders and external webs of the\\r\\nprimaries, secondaries and wing-coverts grey; tail, bill and feet black.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Plate represents the bird in two different positions, of the natural\\r\\nsize.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration:\\r\\n\\r\\n  PACHYCEPHALA RUFOGULARIS: _Gould_.\\r\\n\\r\\n  _J.

Its stronghold,\\r\\nprobably a part of the vast country of the interior, has yet to be\\r\\ndiscovered. From the little I saw of it, I am induced to believe that it\\r\\nis a very solitary bird, for I always encountered it singly, and mostly\\r\\nhopping about on the ground in the thinly-timbered forest which\\r\\nsurrounds the city of Adelaide. Its actions were so particularly quiet,\\r\\nand its plumage so unattractive, that had not my attention been directed\\r\\nto birds of a sombre hue as well as to those of gay attire, I might have\\r\\neasily overlooked it. I never heard it utter any note, nor did I observe\\r\\nanything in its habits and economy worthy of remark. It doubtless\\r\\nresorted to the ground for coleopterous and other insects, the remains\\r\\nof which formed the contents of the stomachs of those I procured.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe adult males and females differ considerably in the colouring of\\r\\ntheir plumage; the young males resemble the females. The rusty colouring\\r\\nof the throat and face distinguishes this species from every other\\r\\nmember of the genus.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs South Australia is the only country in which this rare species has\\r\\nyet been discovered, and as nothing whatever is known of its history, I\\r\\nwould call the attention of future collectors to the subject, with a\\r\\nview of procuring information respecting it; and when I state that my\\r\\nspecimens were procured within two miles of the city of Adelaide, it\\r\\nwill be admitted that I am not imposing too great a task on my talented\\r\\nfriend Governor Grey, and the other residents at Adelaide.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe male has the crown of the head and all the upper surface deep\\r\\nbrownish grey; wings and tail dark brown, the feathers margined with\\r\\ngreyish brown; lores, chin, throat, under surface of the shoulder and\\r\\nall the under surface reddish sandy brown, crossed on the breast by a\\r\\nbroad irregular band of greyish brown; irides reddish brown; bill black;\\r\\nfeet blackish brown.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe female differs from the male in having the throat and under surface\\r\\ngreyish white, the chest being crossed by an obscure mark of greyish\\r\\nbrown, and with a line down the centre of each feather.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Plate represents the two sexes of the natural size.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration:\\r\\n\\r\\n  PACHYCEPHALA GILBERTII: _Gould_.\\r\\n\\r\\n  _J.

The\\r\\nspecimens transmitted to me by Mr. Gilbert are I believe all that have\\r\\nyet been procured.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough the _P. Gilbertii_ is nearly allied to the _P. rufogularis_, it\\r\\nmay be readily distinguished by the rufous colouring being confined to\\r\\nthe throat, and not ascending upon the forehead and occupying the space\\r\\nbetween the bill and the eyes as in that species; it is also a smaller\\r\\nbird in all its admeasurements.\\r\\n\\r\\nGilbert’s Pachycephala is an inhabitant of the interior of Western\\r\\nAustralia. The following notes, which are all that is known of its\\r\\nhistory, accompanied the specimens sent to me:—“This species inhabits\\r\\nthe thick brushes of the interior. It is an early breeder, as is proved\\r\\nby my finding a nest with three newly-hatched young birds in the middle\\r\\nof August. The nest was built in the upright fork of a small shrub about\\r\\nfour feet from the ground. It was deep, cup-shaped in form, and\\r\\nconstructed of dried grasses, and except that it was rather more\\r\\ncompactly built, it was very similar to those of the other members of\\r\\nthe genus.”\\r\\n\\r\\nI trust that the publication of this species will induce Mr. Burgess,\\r\\nMr. Drummond and other residents in Western Australia to seek for and\\r\\ninvestigate its history. To Mr. Drummond, and his son Mr. Johnson\\r\\nDrummond, botanical science is indebted for many valuable discoveries,\\r\\nand that this slight tribute to their labours in that department may\\r\\ninduce them to turn their attention to other branches of natural history\\r\\nis my earnest wish.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sexes of the present bird, as will be seen on reference to the\\r\\naccompanying Plate, exhibit a similar difference in colour as in the _P.\\r\\nrufogularis_; the females of both species being very sombre and devoid\\r\\nof any rufous colouring on the throat and breast.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe male has the upper surface dark greyish olive-brown; head dark\\r\\nslate-grey; breast of a lighter grey; lores black; throat rust-red;\\r\\nunder surface of the shoulder, centre of the abdomen and under\\r\\ntail-coverts sandy buff; irides light brown; bill and feet black.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe figures represent the two sexes of the natural size.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration:\\r\\n\\r\\n  PACHYCEPHALA SIMPLEX: _Gould_.\\r\\n\\r\\n  _J.

Its\\r\\nvoice, which is peculiarly soft and mournful, consists of a single note\\r\\nfour times repeated with rather lengthened intervals; this however\\r\\nappears to be its call-note only, for at other times it utters a\\r\\nsomewhat pleasing and lengthened song; “but,” says Mr. Gilbert, “I never\\r\\nheard it emit that sharp terminating note, resembling the smack of a\\r\\nwhip, which concludes the song of all the other species of the genus.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe stomach is muscular, and the food consists of insects and seeds of\\r\\nvarious kinds.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt appears to breed during the months of December, January and February,\\r\\nfor the ovarium of a female killed on the third of the last-mentioned\\r\\nmonth contained eggs very fully developed, and from the bare state of\\r\\nthe breast appeared to have been already engaged in the task of\\r\\nincubation.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll the upper surface brown; under surface brownish white, with a very\\r\\nfaint stripe of brown down the centre of each feather; irides light\\r\\nbrown; bill and feet black.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Plate represents the two sexes of the natural size.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration:\\r\\n\\r\\n  PACHYCEPHALA OLIVACEA: _Vig. & Horsf._\\r\\n\\r\\n  _J.

It is rather recluse in its habits, and were it not for\\r\\nits oft-repeated, loud, sharp, liquid, whistling note, its presence\\r\\nwould not often be detected. I usually met with it in the thickest parts\\r\\nof the forests, where it appeared to resort to the ground rather than to\\r\\nthe branches, and to frequent gulleys and low swampy situations beneath\\r\\nthe branches of the dwarf _Eucalypti_ and other trees, with which its\\r\\nolive colouring so closely assimilated, that it was very difficult to\\r\\nperceive it.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough I felt assured that the bird was breeding in many parts of the\\r\\ncountry, and made repeated attempts to discover its nest, I could never\\r\\nsucceed in so doing; the eggs are therefore among the desiderata of my\\r\\ncabinet.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut little outward difference is observable in the sexes; the male is\\r\\nrather the largest and has the head of a sooty greyish brown, while the\\r\\nhead of the female is olive-brown.

Hist., vol. v. p. 124?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the members of this genus, originally formed on a single species, are\\r\\nnow found to be numerous, but all very nearly allied, it becomes\\r\\nnecessary to describe this, the typical bird, with particular accuracy.\\r\\nNearly every colony appears to be inhabited by its own peculiar species;\\r\\nand accordingly we find that the present bird is an inhabitant of New\\r\\nSouth Wales, but extends its range westward as far as South Australia\\r\\nand eastward to Moreton Bay, and perhaps farther.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe _Colluricincla harmonica_ is one of the oldest known of the\\r\\nAustralian birds, having been described in Latham’s “Index\\r\\nOrnithologicus,” figured in White’s “Voyage,” and included in the works\\r\\nof all subsequent writers.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo generally is it dispersed over the countries of which it is a native,\\r\\nthat there are few localities in which it is not to be found; the\\r\\nbrushes near the coast as well as the plains of the interior being\\r\\nequally frequented by it; it is a very active bird, living much among\\r\\nthe branches, and feeding upon insects of various kinds, caterpillars\\r\\nand their larvæ.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe term _harmonica_ applied to this species is very appropriate; for\\r\\nalthough it does not give utterance to any continued song, it frequently\\r\\npours forth a number of powerful swelling notes, louder but less varied\\r\\nthan those of the Song Thrush of Europe; and it is somewhat singular\\r\\nthat these notes are emitted while in the act of feeding, and while\\r\\nengaged in the search of its insect food.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe site of the nest is very varied; sometimes a hollow in the upright\\r\\nbole of a small tree is chosen; at others the ledge of a decayed branch,\\r\\nor a rock, or any similar situation. The nest is a cup-shaped, and\\r\\nsomewhat slight structure, externally composed of the outer and inner\\r\\nbark of trees and leaves, and lined with fibrous roots; I have\\r\\noccasionally seen wool intermingled with the outer materials. The eggs,\\r\\nwhich are three in number, and one inch and two lines long by ten lines\\r\\nbroad, are of a beautiful pearly white, thinly sprinkled with large\\r\\nblotches of light chestnut-brown and dull bluish grey, the latter colour\\r\\nappearing as if beneath the surface of the shell. In one instance I\\r\\nfound a nest of eggs which were brownish white instead of pearly white.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sexes are very nearly alike, the only difference being that the\\r\\nfemale has the bill browner and an indication of a white stripe over the\\r\\neye.\\r\\n\\r\\nHead brownish grey, with an indistinct line of brown down the centre of\\r\\neach feather; back of the neck, back and shoulders olive-brown; wings\\r\\nslaty black margined with grey; rump and tail grey, the latter with dark\\r\\nbrown shafts; under surface light brownish grey, fading into pure white\\r\\non the vent and under tail-coverts and greyish white on the throat, each\\r\\nof the throat and breast feathers with a fine line of brown down the\\r\\ncentre; irides dark brown; bill blackish brown; feet dark greenish grey.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Plate represents a male and a female on a nest, all of the natural\\r\\nsize.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration:\\r\\n\\r\\n  COLLURICINCLA RUFIVENTRIS: _Gould_.\\r\\n\\r\\n  _J.

It is a native of\\r\\nWestern Australia, where it is to be found in all thickly wooded places,\\r\\nfeeding as much on the ground as among the trees and scrubs. In its\\r\\nactions, the positions it assumes, and in its general manners, it very\\r\\nclosely resembles the Common Thrush of Europe. Its voice is a very loud,\\r\\nfull and rich swelling note with a few connecting sounds, the whole much\\r\\nresembling, but not equalling in melody, the call-note of the European\\r\\nThrush.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt breeds in the latter part of September and the beginning of October,\\r\\nand the nest, which is generally placed in the hollow part of a high\\r\\ntree, is formed of dried strips of gum-tree bark very closely packed and\\r\\ndeep, and is sometimes lined with soft grasses. The eggs, which are two\\r\\nor three in number, are of a beautiful bluish or pearly white, with\\r\\nlarge blotches of reddish olive-brown and dark grey, the latter\\r\\nappearing as if beneath the surface of the shell; the medium length of\\r\\nthe eggs is one inch and one line by ten lines in breadth.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Gilbert mentions that upon two occasions he found the eggs of this\\r\\nbird in old nests of _Pomatorhinus superciliosus_.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe stomach is muscular, and the food consists of insects, principally\\r\\nof the coleopterous order, and seeds.\\r\\n\\r\\nLores greyish white; crown of the head and all the upper surface deep\\r\\ngrey, slightly tinged with olive; primaries and tail dark brown,\\r\\nmargined with brownish grey; throat and under surface darkish grey,\\r\\npassing into buff on the vent and under tail-coverts; all the feathers\\r\\nof the under surface have a narrow dark line down the centre; thighs\\r\\ngrey; irides dark reddish brown; bill blackish brown; feet dark greenish\\r\\nleaden grey.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe figures represent a male and a female of the natural size.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration:\\r\\n\\r\\n  COLLURICINCLA BRUNNEA: _Gould_.\\r\\n\\r\\n  _J.

The eggs are of a\\r\\npearly bluish white, spotted and blotched with markings of olive-brown\\r\\nand grey, the latter colour appearing as if beneath the surface of the\\r\\nshell; their medium length is one inch and two lines by ten lines in\\r\\nbreadth.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is a larger and more robust species than either _C. harmonica_ or _C.\\r\\nrufiventris_, the bill is shorter and much stouter, and the colouring is\\r\\nof a uniform light brown; even the primaries and tail-feathers are of\\r\\nthe same hue.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll the upper surface pale brown; primaries and tail the same, but\\r\\nsomewhat lighter; all the under surface brownish white, becoming almost\\r\\npure white on the vent and under tail-coverts; thighs greyish brown;\\r\\nbill black; feet blackish brown.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Plate represents the two sexes of the natural size.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration:\\r\\n\\r\\n  COLLURICINCLA SELBII: _Jard._\\r\\n\\r\\n  _J.

It\\r\\nis distinguished from all the other members of the genus by the greater\\r\\nlength of the bill, and by the female having a broad stripe of rust-red\\r\\nover the eye. It does not appear to confine itself to any particular\\r\\npart of the forest, for it may sometimes be observed on the low scrub\\r\\nnear the ground, and at others on the topmost branches of the highest\\r\\ntrees.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt feeds on caterpillars and insects of various kinds, which it often\\r\\nprocures by tearing off the bark from the branches of the trees in the\\r\\nmost dexterous manner with its powerful bill, and while thus employed\\r\\nfrequently pours forth its remarkable note. In disposition it is lively\\r\\nand animated, confident and fearless, and might doubtless be easily\\r\\ntamed, when it would become a most interesting bird for the aviary.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe nest, although composed of coarse materials, is a remarkably neat\\r\\nstructure, round, rather deep and cup-shaped, outwardly formed of strips\\r\\nof the rind of the stringy bark-tree and lined with a few grasses; it is\\r\\nabout five inches in diameter and four in height, the interior being\\r\\nthree inches and a half in breadth by two and a half in depth. The sites\\r\\nusually selected for the nest are the hollow open stump of a tree, a\\r\\ncleft in a rock, &c.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sexes, which differ considerably from each other, may be thus\\r\\ndescribed:—\\r\\n\\r\\nThe male has the general plumage dark slate-grey, deepening into brown\\r\\non the back and wings, much paler on the under surface, and fading into\\r\\nwhite on the throat and breast; over the eye a faint stripe of greyish\\r\\nwhite; bill black; irides brown; feet light lead-colour.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe female has all the upper surface, wings and tail brown; upper\\r\\ntail-coverts slate-grey; over the eye a stripe of rust-red; under\\r\\nsurface light grey tinged with brown on the throat and breast, and each\\r\\nfeather with a stripe of dark brown down the centre; bill horn-colour at\\r\\nthe base, black at the tip.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe young is similar to the female, but has the stripes of the under\\r\\nsurface much broader and more conspicuous, the line over the eye of a\\r\\ndeeper red, and the tail grey.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Plate represents a male, a female, and a young bird of the natural\\r\\nsize.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration:\\r\\n\\r\\n  COLLURICINCLA PARVULA: _Gould_.\\r\\n\\r\\n  _J.

Mr. Gilbert, to whose notes I must\\r\\nrefer for all that is known about it, states that it is an inhabitant of\\r\\nthe thickets; is an extremely shy bird, and is generally seen on or near\\r\\nthe ground. Its note is a fine thrush-like tone, very clear, loud and\\r\\nmelodious. The stomach is muscular, and the food consists of insects of\\r\\nvarious kinds, but principally of coleoptera. The nest and eggs were\\r\\nbrought me by a native; they were taken from the hollow part of a tree\\r\\nabout four feet from the ground; the former, which was too much injured\\r\\nto be preserved, was formed of small twigs and narrow strips of the bark\\r\\nof a _Melaleuca_. The eggs were two in number, of a beautiful pearly\\r\\nflesh-white, regularly spotted all over with dull reddish orange and\\r\\number-brown; like the eggs of the other species of the genus, they are\\r\\nalso sprinkled over with bluish markings, which appear as if beneath the\\r\\nsurface of the shell; their medium length is one inch, and breadth nine\\r\\nlines.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sexes are so nearly alike in plumage, that they are not readily\\r\\ndistinguished from each other; but the male is somewhat larger than his\\r\\nmate.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll the upper surface, wings and tail olive-brown; a faint line over the\\r\\neye and the chin white; all the under surface pale buff, the feathers of\\r\\nthe throat and breast with a broad stripe of brown down the centre;\\r\\nirides dark brownish red; bill blackish grey; tarsi bluish grey.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe figures are of the natural size.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration:\\r\\n\\r\\n  FALCUNCULUS FRONTATUS: _Vieill._\\r\\n\\r\\n  _J. & E.

It does not inhabit Western\\r\\nAustralia, neither have I as yet received it from the north coast. It\\r\\nalike inhabits the thick brushes as well as the trees of the open\\r\\nplains. Its chief food is insects, which are either obtained among the\\r\\nfoliage or under the bark of the larger branches and trunks of the\\r\\ntrees; in procuring these it displays great dexterity, stripping off the\\r\\nbark in the most determined manner, for which purpose its powerful bill\\r\\nis admirably adapted.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is very animated and sprightly in its actions, and in many of its\\r\\nhabits bears a striking resemblance to the Tits, particularly in the\\r\\nmanner in which it clings to and climbs among the branches in search of\\r\\nfood. While thus employed it frequently erects its crest and assumes\\r\\nmany pert and lively positions: no bird of its size with which I am\\r\\nacquainted possesses greater strength in its mandibles, or is capable of\\r\\ninflicting severer wounds, as I experienced on handling one I had\\r\\npreviously winged, and which fastened on my hand in the most ferocious\\r\\nmanner.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs far as I am aware, the _Falcunculus frontatus_ is not distinguished\\r\\nby any powers of song, merely uttering a few low piping notes.\\r\\n\\r\\nI could neither succeed in procuring the nest of this species nor obtain\\r\\nany authentic information respecting its nidification.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe stomachs of the specimens I dissected were filled with the larvæ of\\r\\ninsects and berries.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe male has immediately above the bill a narrow band of white, from\\r\\nwhich, down the centre of the head, is a broad stripe of black feathers\\r\\nforming a crest; sides of the face and head white, divided by a line of\\r\\nblack which passes through the eye to the nape; back, shoulders and\\r\\nwing-coverts olive; primaries and secondaries blackish brown broadly\\r\\nmargined with grey; tail blackish brown broadly margined with grey,\\r\\nespecially on the two centre feathers; two outer tail-feathers and tips\\r\\nof the remainder white, the white diminishing on each feather as it\\r\\napproaches the centre of the tail; throat black; all the under surface\\r\\nbright yellow; irides reddish brown; bill black; legs and feet bluish\\r\\ngrey.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sexes may at all times be distinguished from each other by the\\r\\nsmaller size of the female, and by the colouring of the throat being\\r\\ngreen instead of black; by the irides being darker and the feet bluish\\r\\nlead-colour.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Plate represents a male and a female of the natural size, on a\\r\\nbranch of a shrub-like tree which I gathered in the district of\\r\\nIllawarra, but of which I have not been able to obtain the name.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration:\\r\\n\\r\\n  FALCUNCULUS LEUCOGASTER: _Gould_.\\r\\n\\r\\n  _J. & E.

It is usually seen in pairs among the thickly-foliaged trees,\\r\\nparticularly such as grow in quiet secluded places, and is a most active\\r\\nlittle bird, running over the trunks and branches of the trees with the\\r\\ngreatest facility, and tearing off the bark in its progress in search of\\r\\ninsects: the habits in fact of the present and Frontal Shrike-Tit are so\\r\\nclosely similar that a separate description is unnecessary. Its flight\\r\\nis of short duration, and is seldom employed for any other purpose than\\r\\nthat of flitting from branch to branch, or from one tree to another. Its\\r\\nnote is a series of mournful sounds, the last of which is drawn out to a\\r\\ngreater length than the preceding ones.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe stomach is extremely muscular, and its food consists principally of\\r\\ncoleoptera.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe male has immediately above the bill a narrow hand of white, from\\r\\nwhich, down the centre of the head, is a broad stripe of black feathers\\r\\nforming a crest; sides of the face and head white, divided by a line of\\r\\nblack, which passes through the eye to the nape; back, rump, shoulders\\r\\nand wing-coverts bright yellowish olive; primaries and secondaries\\r\\nblackish brown, margined with olive-yellow; tail-feathers blackish\\r\\nbrown, margined with olive-yellow, except the two outer, which are grey,\\r\\nbroadly margined with white; all the tail-feathers tipped with white,\\r\\nthe white diminishing on each feather as it approaches the centre of the\\r\\ntail; throat black; chest, upper part of the breast, and under\\r\\ntail-coverts bright yellow; abdomen and thighs white; irides wood-brown;\\r\\nbill dark brown, becoming lighter at the edges of the mandibles; legs\\r\\nand feet greenish blue.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe female differs from her mate in being somewhat smaller in size, and\\r\\nin having the throat green instead of black.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe figures are those of a male and female, of the natural size.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration:\\r\\n\\r\\n  OREOÏCA GUTTURALIS.\\r\\n\\r\\n  _J.

It has not yet been discovered in Van Diemen’s Land or in\\r\\nany of the islands in Bass’s Straits, neither has the extent of its\\r\\nrange northwards yet been ascertained. It is, I believe, everywhere a\\r\\nstationary species, but although its distribution is so general, it is\\r\\nnowhere very plentiful. From what I observed of it, it appeared to give\\r\\na decided preference to the naked sterile crowns of hills and open bare\\r\\nglades in the forests, and I should say that its presence is indicative\\r\\nof a poor and bad land. It resorts much to the ground, over the surface\\r\\nof which it hops with great quickness, often in small companies of from\\r\\nthree to six in number. When flushed it flies but a short distance,\\r\\ngenerally to a large horizontal branch of a neighbouring _Eucalyptus_,\\r\\nalong which it passes in a succession of quick hops, similar to those of\\r\\nthe Common Sparrow of Europe. It is very animated in many of its\\r\\nactions, particularly the male, whose erected crest and white face,\\r\\nrelieved by the beautiful orange-colour of the eye, gives it a very\\r\\nsprightly appearance. The female, on the other hand, being nearly\\r\\nuniform in colour, having the eye hazel and the crest less developed, is\\r\\nby no means so attractive. I regret much that it is not in my power to\\r\\nconvey an idea of the note uttered by this bird, which is singular in\\r\\nthe extreme; besides which it is a perfect ventriloquist, its peculiar,\\r\\nmournful, piping whistle appearing to be at a considerable distance,\\r\\nwhile the bird is perched on a large branch of a neighbouring tree. To\\r\\naid my recollections I find the following remarks in my\\r\\nnote-book:—“Note, a very peculiar piping whistle, sounding like\\r\\n_weet-weet-weet-weet-oo_, the last syllable fully drawn out and very\\r\\nmelodious.” In Western Australia, where the real Bell-bird is never\\r\\nfound, this species has had that appellation given to it,—a term which\\r\\nmust appear ill-applied to those who have heard the note of the true\\r\\nBell-bird of the brushes of New South Wales, whose tinkling sound so\\r\\nnearly resembles that of a distant sheep-bell as occasionally to deceive\\r\\nthe ears of a practised shepherd. My assistant Mr. Gilbert having also\\r\\nnoted down to the best of his power the singular note of this species, I\\r\\ngive it in his own words, but neither his description nor my own can\\r\\nconvey anything like an accurate idea of it; notes of birds, in fact,\\r\\nare not to be described,—they must be heard to be understood. “The most\\r\\nsingular feature,” says Mr. Gilbert, “connected with this bird is, that\\r\\nit is a perfect ventriloquist. At first its note commences in so low a\\r\\ntone that it sounds as if at a considerable distance, and then gradually\\r\\nincreases in volume until it appears over the head of the wondering\\r\\nhearer, the bird that utters it being all the while on the dead part of\\r\\na tree, perhaps not more than three or four yards distant; its\\r\\nmotionless attitude rendering its discovery very difficult. It has two\\r\\nkinds of song, the most usual of which is a running succession of notes,\\r\\nor two notes repeated together rather slowly, followed by a repetition\\r\\nthree times rather quickly, the last note resembling the sound of a bell\\r\\nfrom its ringing tone; the other song is pretty nearly the same, only\\r\\nthat it concludes with a sudden and peculiar fall of two notes.”\\r\\n\\r\\nIt flies in heavy undulating sweeps, generally so near the ground that\\r\\nit seems as if it would scarcely take the trouble to rise above the\\r\\nscrub or small trees that may lie in its course.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Western Australia its nest is formed of strings of bark, lined with a\\r\\nfew fine dried grasses, and is generally placed in a _Xanthorrea_ or\\r\\ngrass-tree, either in the upper part of the grass or rush above, or in\\r\\nthe fork of the trunk, and is of a deep cup-shaped form. It breeds in\\r\\nOctober, and generally lays three eggs, which vary much in colour; the\\r\\nground-tint being bluish white, in some instances marked all over with\\r\\nminute spots of ink-black, in others with long zigzag lines and blotches\\r\\nof the same hue. In some these markings are confined to the larger end,\\r\\nwhere they form a zone; in others they are equally spread all over the\\r\\nsurface, intermingled with the black markings; also blotches of grey\\r\\nappear as if beneath the surface of the shell, and some eggs have been\\r\\nfound with the ground-colour of the larger end of a beautiful bluish\\r\\ngreen.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn its nidification and in many of its actions it offers considerable\\r\\nresemblance to the members of the genus _Colluricincla_.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt has a thick muscular gizzard, and its food consists of seeds, grain,\\r\\ncoleoptera, and the larvæ of all kinds of insects. In Western Australia\\r\\nit often resorts to newly ploughed land, as it there finds an abundance\\r\\nof grubs and caterpillars, its most favourite food.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sexes present considerable difference in colour.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe male has the face white; feathers on the forepart of the head, along\\r\\nthe centre of the crest, line from the eye bounding the white of the\\r\\nface, and a large gorget-shaped mark on the breast deep black; sides of\\r\\nthe head and crest grey; all the upper surface and flanks light brown;\\r\\nwings brown margined with lighter brown; tail dark brown; centre of the\\r\\nabdomen brownish white; vent and under tail-coverts buff; irides\\r\\nbeautiful orange, surrounded by a narrow black lash; bill black; legs\\r\\nand feet blackish brown.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe female resembles the male, but differs in having the face and\\r\\nforehead grey, only a line of black down the centre of the crest, the\\r\\nchin dull white, in having a mere indication of the black gorget, the\\r\\nirides hazel, and the feet olive- or dark brown.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe figures are of the natural size.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration:\\r\\n\\r\\n  DICRURUS BRACTEATUS: _Gould_.\\r\\n\\r\\n  _J.

Soc., Part x. p. 132.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHaving carefully compared the bird here represented with the other\\r\\nspecies of the genus inhabiting Africa, the continent of India and the\\r\\nIndian islands, I find it to be quite distinct from the whole of them; I\\r\\nhave therefore assigned to it a separate specific title, and selected\\r\\nthat of _bracteatus_ as expressive of its beautifully spangled\\r\\nappearance. Its range is very extensive, the bird being equally abundant\\r\\nin all parts of the northern and eastern portions of Australia; it was\\r\\nfound by Captain Grey on the north-west coast, by Mr. Gilbert at Port\\r\\nEssington, and it has also been observed in the neighbourhood of Moreton\\r\\nBay on the east coast. I did not encounter it myself during my rambles\\r\\nin Australia; we are therefore indebted to Mr. Gilbert’s notes for all\\r\\nthat is known of its history. “This species,” says he, “is one of the\\r\\ncommonest birds of the Cobourg Peninsula, where it is generally seen in\\r\\npairs and may be met with in every variety of situation, but more\\r\\nfrequently among the thickets and mangroves than elsewhere. It is at all\\r\\ntimes exceedingly active and is strictly insectivorous; its food\\r\\nconsisting entirely of insects of various kinds, but particularly those\\r\\nbelonging to the orders _Coleoptera_ and _Neuroptera_. Its mode of\\r\\nflight and its voice are both exceedingly variable; its usual note is a\\r\\nloud, disagreeably harsh, cackling or creaking whistle, so totally\\r\\ndifferent from that of any other bird, that having been once heard it is\\r\\nreadily recognised.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I found five nests on the 16th of November, all of which contained\\r\\nyoung birds, some of them nearly able to fly, and others apparently but\\r\\njust emerged from the egg. The whole of these nests were exactly alike\\r\\nand formed of the same material, the dry wiry climbing stalk of a common\\r\\nparasitic plant, without any kind of lining; they were exceedingly\\r\\ndifficult to examine from their being placed on the weakest part of the\\r\\nextremities of the horizontal branches of a thickly-foliaged tree at an\\r\\naltitude of not less than thirty feet from the ground; they were of a\\r\\nvery shallow form, about five inches and a half in diameter; the eggs\\r\\nwould seem to be three or four in number, as three of the nests\\r\\ncontained three, and the other two four young birds in each.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe head and the body both above and below are deep black, the feathers\\r\\nof the head with a crescent, and those of the body, particularly of the\\r\\nbreast, with a spot of deep metallic green at the tip; wings and tail\\r\\ndeep glossy green; under wing-coverts black tipped with white; irides\\r\\nbrownish red; bill and feet blackish brown.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Plate represents a specimen procured at Port Essington of the\\r\\nnatural size, and I may remark that examples obtained in that locality\\r\\nare somewhat smaller than those killed on the north-western and eastern\\r\\ncoasts.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration:\\r\\n\\r\\n  RHIPIDURA ALBISCAPA: _Gould_.\\r\\n\\r\\n  _J. & E.

Soc., September 8,\\r\\n            1840.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIt would appear that two species of Fantailed Flycatchers have hitherto\\r\\nbeen confounded under one specific appellation; for if a comparison be\\r\\nmade, it will be obvious to every one, that the bird here represented is\\r\\nquite distinct from that described and figured by Latham, in the sixth\\r\\nvolume of his “General History of Birds,” as _Motacilla flabellifera_,\\r\\nand which he states is a native of New Zealand. It is true, the\\r\\nAustralian birds from different localities present considerable\\r\\nvariations in the depth of their colour, still they never have the\\r\\nlateral tail-feathers entirely white as in the New Zealand bird:\\r\\nspecimens from Van Diemen’s Land are always much darker than those of\\r\\nthe continent, and have the tail-feathers less marked with white; others\\r\\nfrom Western Australia, again, are somewhat lighter in colour, and have\\r\\nthe white markings of the tail more extensive than in those collected in\\r\\nSouth Australia or New South Wales. The accompanying illustration\\r\\nrepresents the darkest of these varieties, and with the nest and plant\\r\\n(_Culcitium salicinum_) was drawn in Van Diemen’s Land.\\r\\n\\r\\nJudging from what facts I could gather respecting the economy of the\\r\\nWhite-shafted Fantail, I am induced to regard it as a permanent resident\\r\\nrather than a migratory species, changing its localities according to\\r\\nthe season of the year; resorting to the more open parts during the\\r\\nsummer months, and retiring in autumn to thick brushes and warm secluded\\r\\ngullies, where it still finds a supply of food, such as _aphides_ and\\r\\nother small insects, upon which it almost exclusively subsists.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Van Diemen’s Land I have seen it in the depth of winter in the\\r\\ngullies on the sunny sides of Mount Wellington; and it is my opinion,\\r\\nthat instead of migrating they only retire at this season to such\\r\\nlocalities as are sheltered from the bleak south-westerly winds which\\r\\nthen so generally prevail, and where insects are still to be found. The\\r\\nbird is also subject to the same law on the continent of Australia; but\\r\\nas the temperature of that country is more equable, its effects are not\\r\\nso apparent; and in support of this opinion I may adduce the remark of\\r\\nCaley, who says, “The species is very common about Paramatta; and I do\\r\\nnot recollect having missed it at any period of the year.”\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is generally found in pairs, but I have occasionally seen as many as\\r\\nfour or five together. It inhabits alike the topmost branches of the\\r\\nhighest trees, those of a more moderate growth, and the shrouded and\\r\\ngloomy foliaged dells in the neighbourhood of rivulets: from these\\r\\nretreats it darts out a short distance to capture insects, and in most\\r\\ninstances returns again to the same branch it had left. While in the air\\r\\nit assumes a number of lively and beautiful positions, at one moment\\r\\nmounting almost perpendicularly, constantly spreading out its tail to\\r\\nthe full extent, and frequently tumbling completely over in the descent;\\r\\nat another it may be seen flitting through the branches, and seeking for\\r\\ninsects among the flowers and leaves, repeatedly uttering a sweet\\r\\ntwittering song.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Fantail is rather a late breeder, scarcely ever commencing before\\r\\nOctober, during which and the three following months it rears two, and\\r\\noften three broods. Its elegant little nest, closely resembling a\\r\\nwine-glass in shape, is woven together with exquisite skill, and is\\r\\ngenerally composed of the inner bark of a species of _Eucalyptus_,\\r\\nneatly lined with the down of the tree-fern intermingled with flowering\\r\\nstalks of moss, and outwardly matted together with the webs of spiders,\\r\\nwhich not only serve to envelope the nest, but are also employed to\\r\\nstrengthen its attachment to the branch on which it is constructed. The\\r\\nsituation of the nest is much varied: I have observed it in the midst of\\r\\ndense brushes, in the more open forest, and placed on a branch\\r\\noverhanging a mountain rivulet, but at all times within a few feet of\\r\\nthe ground. The eggs are invariably two in number, seven lines long;\\r\\ntheir ground colour white, blotched all over, but particularly at the\\r\\nlarger end, with brown slightly tinged with olive: the young from the\\r\\nnest assume so closely the colour and appearance of the adults, that\\r\\nthey are only to be distinguished by the secondaries and wing-coverts\\r\\nbeing margined with brown, a feature lost after the first moult. The\\r\\nadults are so precisely alike, that actual dissection is necessary to\\r\\ndetermine the sexes.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn its disposition this little bird is one of the tamest imaginable,\\r\\nallowing of a near approach without evincing the slightest timidity, and\\r\\nwill even enter the houses of persons resident in the bush in pursuit of\\r\\ngnats and other insects. During the breeding-season, however, it\\r\\nexhibits extreme anxiety at the sight of an intruder in the vicinity of\\r\\nits nest, the site of which is always betrayed by its becoming more\\r\\nagitated and active in its movements as he draws near: if approached\\r\\nunobserved, it may be often seen mounting in the air and singing while\\r\\nits mate is performing the duty of incubation.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom what I have here stated it will be seen that this species has a\\r\\nmost extensive range over the southern portion of Australia, and in all\\r\\nprobability it will be found in every part of that vast country.\\r\\n\\r\\nAdult birds from Van Diemen’s Land have the whole of the upper surface,\\r\\near-coverts, and a band across the chest sooty black, slightly tinged\\r\\nwith olive, the tail, crown of the head, and pectoral band being rather\\r\\nthe darkest; stripe over the eye, lunar-shaped mark behind the eye,\\r\\nthroat, tips of the wing-coverts, margins of the secondaries, shafts,\\r\\nouter webs and tips of all but the two middle tail-feathers white; under\\r\\nsurface buff; eyes black; bill and feet brownish black.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe figures are of the natural size.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration:\\r\\n\\r\\n  RHIPIDURA RUFIFRONS.\\r\\n\\r\\n  _J.

I\\r\\nmet with it on the 15th of October 1807, at Cardunny, a place about ten\\r\\nmiles to the north-east of Paramatta. It is a thick brush (or\\r\\nunderwood), and is the resort of the _great Bat_.” The fact of the\\r\\ncolony having at that early date been but little explored will readily\\r\\naccount for Caley’s opinion of the rarity of this bird; but had he\\r\\nvisited the thick brushes of Illawarra, the Liverpool range and the\\r\\nHunter, he would have found that those situations are its natural\\r\\nhabitat, and that it is there to be met with in considerable numbers.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough many of its habits closely resemble those of the _Rhipidura\\r\\nalbiscapa_, they are, as the greater length of its legs would indicate,\\r\\nfar more terrestrial; it runs over the ground and the fallen logs of\\r\\ntrees with great facility; while thus engaged, and particularly when\\r\\napproached by an intruder, it constantly spreads and displays its\\r\\nbeautiful tail, and evinces a great degree of restlessness. It is always\\r\\nfound in the most secluded parts of the forest, no portion of which\\r\\nappears to be too dense for its abode.\\r\\n\\r\\nI never met with it in Van Diemen’s Land, or on the islands in Bass’s\\r\\nStraits, neither do I recollect having seen it in South Australia; and\\r\\nit has not been found in Western Australia, or on the north coast, in\\r\\nwhich latter locality it is represented by the _Rhipidura Dryas_.\\r\\n\\r\\nI had no opportunity of observing it during the breeding-season, but\\r\\nfrequently encountered its deserted little cup-shaped nests, which bore\\r\\na general resemblance to that of the _R. albiscapa_, figured on the\\r\\npreceding plate.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sexes are precisely alike in colour; and their only outward\\r\\ndifference consists in the somewhat smaller size of the female.\\r\\n\\r\\nForehead rusty red, continuing over the eye; crown of the head, back of\\r\\nthe neck, upper part of the back and wings olive-brown; lower part of\\r\\nthe back, tail-coverts, and the basal portions of the tail rusty red;\\r\\nremainder of the tail blackish brown, obscurely tipped with light grey;\\r\\nthe shafts of the tail-feathers for nearly half their length from the\\r\\nbase light rusty red; throat and centre of the abdomen white;\\r\\near-coverts dark brown; chest black, the feathers of the lower part\\r\\nedged with white; flanks and under tail-coverts light fawn-colour; eyes,\\r\\nbill and feet brown.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe figures are of the natural size.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration:\\r\\n\\r\\n  RHIPIDURA ISURA: _Gould_.\\r\\n\\r\\n  _J.

A slight difference is\\r\\nobservable in the size of the specimens from different localities, those\\r\\nfrom New South Wales being the largest and those from Port Essington the\\r\\nleast: the latter may hereafter prove to be specifically distinct.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the same time that it is one of the most widely diffused, it is also\\r\\none of the most tame and familiar of the Australian birds, and\\r\\nconsequently a general favourite; it is constantly about the houses,\\r\\ngardens and stock yards of the settlers, often running along the backs\\r\\nand close to the noses of the cattle in order to secure the insects\\r\\nwhich are roused and attracted by the heat from their nostrils, along\\r\\nthe roofs of the buildings, the tops of palings, gates, &c.;\\r\\nconstructing its pretty nest beneath the verandah, and even entering the\\r\\nrooms to capture its insect prey; it passes much of its time on the\\r\\nground, over which it runs and darts with the utmost celerity, and when\\r\\nskirting the stream with tail erect and shaking from side to side, it\\r\\npresents an appearance very similar to that of the English Black and\\r\\nWhite Wagtail (_Motacilla Yarrellii_); the movements of the tails of the\\r\\ntwo birds are, however, very different, that of the European being\\r\\nperpendicular, while that of the Australian is lateral.\\r\\n\\r\\nIts song, which consists of a few rather loud and shrill notes, is\\r\\ncontinually poured forth throughout the entire night, especially if it\\r\\nbe moonlight.\\r\\n\\r\\nIts flight is at times gracefully undulating, at others it consists of a\\r\\nseries of sudden zigzag starts, but is always of a very short duration;\\r\\nit never poises itself in the air, like the _Seïsura volitans_, and\\r\\nnever mounts higher than the tops of the trees, appearing to prefer\\r\\nhopping from tree to tree to flying.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt commences breeding in September and generally rears two or three\\r\\nbroods. Its beautiful deep cup-shaped and compact nest is very often\\r\\nbuilt on a branch overhanging water, or on the dead limb of a tree\\r\\novershadowed by a living branch above it, but the usual and favourite\\r\\nsite is the upper side of a fallen branch without the slightest shelter\\r\\nfrom the sun and rain, at about three or four feet from the ground; the\\r\\nnest itself is constructed of dried grasses, strips of bark, small\\r\\nclumps of grass, roots, &c., all bound and firmly matted together and\\r\\ncovered over with cobwebs, the latter material being at times so similar\\r\\nin appearance to the bark of the branch, that the entire nest looks like\\r\\nan excrescence of the wood, consequently it is almost impossible to\\r\\ndetect it; it is lined with a finer description of grass, small wiry\\r\\nfibrous roots or feathers. The eggs are generally three in number, of a\\r\\ndull greenish white, banded round the centre or towards the larger end\\r\\nwith blotches and spots of blackish and chestnut-brown, which in some\\r\\ninstances are very minute; the medium length of the egg is nine lines\\r\\nand a half by seven lines in breadth. On an intruder approaching the\\r\\nnest, the birds fly about and hover over his head, and will even sit on\\r\\nthe same branch on which the nest is placed while the intruder is in the\\r\\nact of robbing it of the eggs; all the time uttering a peculiar cry,\\r\\nwhich may be compared to the sound of a child’s rattle, or the noise\\r\\nproduced by the small cog-wheels of a steam-mill.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe stomach is muscular, and the food consists of insects of various\\r\\nkinds.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sexes are alike in plumage, and may be thus described:—\\r\\n\\r\\nHead, neck, throat, sides of the chest, upper surface and tail, glossy\\r\\ngreenish black; over each eye a narrow line of white; wings brown;\\r\\nwing-coverts with a small triangular spot of white at the tip; under\\r\\nsurface pale buffy white; irides, bill and feet black.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe figures are of the natural size.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration:\\r\\n\\r\\n  SEÏSURA INQUIETA.\\r\\n\\r\\n  _J.

It is a bird possessing\\r\\nmany peculiar and very singular habits. It not only captures its prey\\r\\nafter the usual manner of the other Flycatchers, but it frequently\\r\\nsallies forth into the open glades of the forest and the cleared lands,\\r\\nand procures it by poising itself in the air with a remarkably quick\\r\\nmotion of the wings, precisely after the manner of the English Kestrel\\r\\n(_Tinnunculus Alaudarius_), every now and then making sudden\\r\\nperpendicular descents to the ground to capture any insect that may\\r\\nattract its notice. It is while performing these singular movements that\\r\\nit produces the remarkable sound, which has procured for it from the\\r\\ncolonists of New South Wales the appellation of “The Grinder.” The\\r\\nsingular habits of this species appear to have attracted the notice of\\r\\nall who have paid any attention to the natural history of New South\\r\\nWales: Mr. Caley observes, “It is very curious in its actions. In\\r\\nalighting on the stump of a tree it makes several semicircular motions,\\r\\nspreading out its tail at the time, and making a loud noise somewhat\\r\\nlike that caused by a razor-grinder at work. I have seen it frequently\\r\\nalight on the ridge of my house, and perform the same evolutions:” and\\r\\nLatham says, “It is observed to hover about two feet from the ground,\\r\\nmaking sudden darts on something, which, by attention, was found to be a\\r\\nsort of worm, which this bird, by a chirping note, and tremulous motion\\r\\nof the wings, with the tail widely expanded, seemed to fascinate out of\\r\\nits hole in the ground.” To this I may add the following account of the\\r\\nactions and manners of this species as observed by Mr. Gilbert in\\r\\nWestern Australia:—\\r\\n\\r\\n“This bird is found in pairs in every variety of situation. Its general\\r\\nnote is a loud harsh cry several times repeated; it also utters a loud\\r\\nclear whistle; but its most singular note is that from which it has\\r\\nobtained its colonial name, and which is only emitted while the bird is\\r\\nin a hovering position at a few feet above the ground; this noise so\\r\\nexactly resembles a grinder at work, that a person unaware of its being\\r\\nproduced by a bird might easily be misled. Its mode of flight is one of\\r\\nthe most graceful and easy imaginable; it rarely mounts high in flying\\r\\nfrom tree to tree, but moves horizontally with its tail but little\\r\\nspread, and with a very slight motion of the wings; it is during this\\r\\nkind of flight that it utters the harsh note above-mentioned; the\\r\\ngrinding note being only emitted during the graceful hovering motion,\\r\\nthe object of which appears to be to attract the notice of the insects\\r\\nbeneath, for it invariably terminates in the bird descending to the\\r\\nground, picking up something, flying into a tree close by, and uttering\\r\\nits shrill and distinct whistle.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe food consists of insects of various kinds, and it is said to devour\\r\\nscorpions also.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe months of September, October and November constitute the\\r\\nbreeding-season. The nests observed by me in New South Wales were rather\\r\\nneatly made, very similar to those of _Rhipidura Motacilloïdes_,\\r\\ncup-shaped, and composed of fine grasses matted together on the outside\\r\\nwith cobwebs, and lined with very fine fibrous roots and a few feathers;\\r\\nthey were placed on horizontal branches frequently overhanging water.\\r\\nThe eggs, which are sometimes only two, but mostly three in number, are\\r\\ndull white, distinctly zoned round the centre with spots of chestnut and\\r\\ngreyish brown, the latter colour appearing as if beneath the surface of\\r\\nthe shell; their medium length is nine lines and a half by seven lines\\r\\nin breadth. The nests found by Mr. Gilbert in Western Australia were\\r\\nremarkably neat and pretty, and were formed of cobwebs, dried soft\\r\\ngrasses, narrow strips of gum-tree bark, the soft paper-like bark of the\\r\\n_Melaleucæ_, &c., and were usually lined with feathers or a fine wiry\\r\\ngrass, and in some instances horse-hair; the situations chosen for its\\r\\nerection are the most difficult of access, being the upper side, the\\r\\nextreme end and the dead portion of a horizontal branch. The bird is\\r\\nvery reluctant to leave the nest, and will almost suffer itself to be\\r\\nhandled rather than desert its eggs.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sexes are very similar in plumage, but the female and young males\\r\\nhave the lores or space between the bill and the eye not so deep a black\\r\\nas in the male.\\r\\n\\r\\nHead and all the upper surface shining bluish black; wings dark brown;\\r\\ntail brownish black; lores deep velvety black; under surface silky\\r\\nwhite, with the exception of the sides of the chest, which are dull\\r\\nblack; irides dark brown; basal half of the sides of the upper mandible\\r\\nand the basal two-thirds of the lower mandible greenish blue; the\\r\\nremainder of the bill bluish black; legs and feet dark bluish brown.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe figures are of the natural size, the upper one exhibiting a rufous\\r\\ntint on the breast, which frequently occurs.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration:\\r\\n\\r\\n  PIEZORHYNCHUS NITIDUS: _Gould_.\\r\\n\\r\\n  _J.

It is by\\r\\nno means scarce at Port Essington, but, from the extreme shyness of its\\r\\ndisposition and the situations it inhabits, it is seldom seen; specimens\\r\\nin fact are not procured without considerable trouble and difficulty. As\\r\\nI have not myself seen the bird in its native haunts, I shall\\r\\ntranscribe, with as little alteration as possible, Mr. Gilbert’s notes\\r\\nrespecting it:—“Inhabits the densest mangroves and thickets, and is\\r\\nusually seen creeping about close to the ground among the fallen trees\\r\\nin the swamps, at which time it utters a note so closely resembling the\\r\\ncroak of a frog, that it might easily be mistaken for the voice of that\\r\\nanimal; this peculiar note would seem to be only emitted while the bird\\r\\nis feeding on the ground; for when it occasionally mounts to the higher\\r\\nbranches of the trees it utters a rather pleasing succession of sounds\\r\\nresembling _twit-te-twite_; on the slightest disturbance it immediately\\r\\ndescends again to the underwood and recommences its frog-like note. The\\r\\nnest is either built among the mangroves, or on the verge of a thicket\\r\\nnear an open spot. One that I found among the mangroves was built on a\\r\\nseedling-tree not more than three feet from the ground; another was on a\\r\\nbranch overhanging a small running stream within reach of the hand;\\r\\nwhile a third, constructed on the branches of the trees bordering a\\r\\nclear space in the centre of a dense thicket, was at least twenty feet\\r\\nhigh. The nest at all times so closely resembles the surrounding\\r\\nbranches, that it is very difficult to detect unless the birds are very\\r\\nclosely watched; in some instances it looks so like an excrescence of\\r\\nthe tree, and in others is so deeply seated in the fork whereon it is\\r\\nplaced, that it can only be discovered when the bird is sitting upon it.\\r\\nThe nest is about two inches and a half in height and three and a\\r\\nquarter in diameter, is of a cup-shaped form, with the rim brought to a\\r\\nsharp edge, and is outwardly composed of the stringy bark of an\\r\\n_Eucalyptus_ bound together on the outside with vegetable fibres, among\\r\\nwhich in some instances cobwebs are mixed: all over the outside of the\\r\\nnest small pieces of bark resembling portions of lichens are attached,\\r\\nsome of them hanging by a single thread and moving about with every\\r\\nbreath of air; the internal surface is lined with a strong wiry\\r\\nthread-like fibrous root, whereby the whole structure is rendered nearly\\r\\nas firm as if it were bound with wire.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe eggs, which are two in number, are ten lines long and seven lines\\r\\nbroad, of a bluish white, blotched and spotted all over with olive and\\r\\ngreyish brown, the spots of the latter hue being less numerous and more\\r\\nobscure; the spots inclining towards the form of a zone at the larger\\r\\nend.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe food consists of insects of various kinds.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe male has the whole of the plumage rich deep glossy greenish black;\\r\\nirides dark brown; bill greyish blue at the base, black at the tip;\\r\\ntarsi greenish grey.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe female has the top and sides of the head and the back of the neck\\r\\nrich deep glossy greenish black; the remainder of the upper surface,\\r\\nwings and tail rusty brown; and the whole of the under surface white.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe figures are those of a male and a female of the natural size.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration:\\r\\n\\r\\n  MYIAGRA PLUMBEA: _Vig. & Horsf._\\r\\n\\r\\n  _J.

Class. of\\r\\n            Birds, vol. ii. p. 260.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA summer visitant to New South Wales, where it takes up its abode on\\r\\nhigh trees bordering-creeks and low valleys, and captures its insect\\r\\nfood under the shady branches, the _Myiägra plumbea_ is mostly seen in\\r\\npairs, which are rather thinly dispersed over the districts forming its\\r\\nusual place of resort. A low whistling note, frequently uttered by the\\r\\nmales, is, in all probability, indicative of the season of love; but\\r\\nwhether it is also uttered at any other than the pairing and breeding\\r\\ntime, I had no opportunities of observing. On the approach of winter it\\r\\nretires northwards from New South Wales, and is not to be met with there\\r\\nuntil the following August or September, the months in which spring\\r\\ncommences in the opposite hemisphere.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is a most active bird; in fact all its positions are characterized by\\r\\ngreat liveliness; for while in a state of comparative repose, or when\\r\\nnot actually in pursuit of insects, it displays a constant tremulous\\r\\nmotion of the tail, by which means its presence is often betrayed when\\r\\nit would otherwise remain unnoticed.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs is the case with all the other members of the genus, the sexes\\r\\npresent considerable difference in their plumage, the female having the\\r\\nthroat of a bright rusty red, while the throat of the male is of a rich\\r\\ngreenish lead-colour, like the upper surface,—a style of colouring which\\r\\nhas suggested the specific name of _plumbea_. The young males during the\\r\\nfirst year so closely assimilate in plumage to the female, that by\\r\\ndissection alone can they be distinguished with certainty.\\r\\n\\r\\nNew South Wales appears to be the great nursery of this species, for I\\r\\nnever met with it either in Van Diemen’s Land or in any other of the\\r\\nAustralian colonies; where then does it go during the colder months of\\r\\nthe year? The woods bordering the north coast are inhabited by a nearly\\r\\nallied but distinct species; the _M. plumbea_ would not therefore be\\r\\nlikely to pass over this country, or to find therein a resting-place\\r\\namong the individuals of another species. If however we consider the\\r\\nvast extent of Australia, and the probability that its central parts may\\r\\nbe far more fertile than is generally supposed, it is not unlikely that\\r\\nthe winter abode of this and numerous other birds will there be found,\\r\\nand that thereby the mysteriously sudden appearance and departure of\\r\\nmany species, which are so frequently taking place, will be readily\\r\\naccounted for.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe nest is cup-shaped, rather deep, formed of moss and lichens and\\r\\nneatly lined with feathers, and is generally placed on the horizontal\\r\\nbranch of a tree. I did not succeed in procuring the eggs.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe male has the whole of the upper surface, wings, tail and breast\\r\\nlead-colour, glossed with green on the head, neck and breast, and\\r\\nbecoming gradually paler towards the extremity of the body and on the\\r\\nwings and tail; primaries slaty black; secondaries faintly margined with\\r\\nwhite; under surface of the wing, abdomen and under tail-coverts white;\\r\\nbill leaden blue, except at the extreme tip, which is black; irides and\\r\\nfeet black.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe female has the head and back lead-colour, without the greenish\\r\\ngloss; wings and tail brown, fringed with bluish grey, particularly the\\r\\nsecondaries; throat and breast rich rusty red, gradually fading into the\\r\\nwhite of the lower part of the abdomen and under tail-coverts; upper\\r\\nmandible black; under mandible pale blue, except at the extremity, which\\r\\nis black.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Plate represents the two sexes of the natural size.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration:\\r\\n\\r\\n  MYIAGRA CONCINNA: _Gould_.\\r\\n\\r\\n  _J.

Like\\r\\nthe other Flycatchers, it has the habit of sitting for a long time on a\\r\\nbranch, watching the various insects as they pass, now and then darting\\r\\nforth and capturing one on the wing, and then returning again to the\\r\\nbranch from which it had flown.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen among the mangroves it utters a rather agreeable twittering song,\\r\\nbut when among the high trees it emits a loud and shrill whistle, drawn\\r\\nout at times to a considerable length.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe stomach is muscular, and the food consists of insects of various\\r\\nkinds and their larvæ.\\r\\n\\r\\nLike the other members of the genus, the sexes differ considerably in\\r\\ncolour; they may be thus described:—\\r\\n\\r\\nThe male has the whole of the upper surface, wings, tail and breast\\r\\nlead-colour, glossed with green on the head, neck and breast, and\\r\\nbecoming gradually paler towards the extremity of the body and on the\\r\\nwings and tail; primaries slaty black; secondaries faintly margined with\\r\\nwhite; under surface of the wing, abdomen and under tail-coverts white;\\r\\nbill leaden blue, except at the extreme tip, which is black; irides\\r\\nbrown; feet blackish grey.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe female has the head and back lead-colour, without the greenish\\r\\ngloss; wings and tail brown, fringed with bluish grey, particularly the\\r\\nsecondaries; throat and breast rich rusty red; abdomen and under\\r\\ntail-coverts white, which colour does not gradually blend with the rusty\\r\\nred of the breast, as in the female of _Myiagra plumbea_; upper mandible\\r\\nblack; under mandible pale blue, except at the tip, which is black.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Plate represents the two sexes of the natural size.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration:\\r\\n\\r\\n  MYIAGRA NITIDA: _Gould_.\\r\\n\\r\\n  _J.

In performing these migrations it necessarily passes directly\\r\\nover the colonies of South Australia and New South Wales, yet it seldom\\r\\noccurs in collections from those countries, and I believe is only seen\\r\\nthere during the passage. It is a most lively, showy and active bird,\\r\\ndarting about from branch to branch and sallying forth in the air in\\r\\npursuit of its insect prey with a most singular, quick, oscillating or\\r\\ntrembling motion of the tail.\\r\\n\\r\\nI experienced but little difficulty in obtaining several of its nests\\r\\nand eggs among the gullies and forest lands on the north side of Mount\\r\\nWellington, particularly those immediately in the rear of New Town, near\\r\\nthe residence of the Rev. Thomas J. Ewing, who frequently accompanied\\r\\nand aided me in my search. The nest is usually placed at the extreme tip\\r\\nof a dead branch, at a height varying from twenty to forty feet from the\\r\\nground. Some nests are formed of a minute species of light green moss,\\r\\nothers are constructed of fine threads of stringy bark; all are rendered\\r\\nvery warm by a dense lining of soft hair, probably that of the opossums\\r\\nor kangaroo rats, and wool, or the soft silk-like threads of the\\r\\nflowering stalks of moss, the down of the tree-fern, and the blossoms of\\r\\nmany other kinds of plants; and the outsides of all are very similar,\\r\\nbeing alike ornamented with small pieces of lichen stuck on without any\\r\\ndegree of regularity; these different materials are all felted together\\r\\nwith cobwebs, or vegetable fibres. The form of the nest appears to\\r\\ndepend upon the nature of the site upon which it is built: if placed on\\r\\na level part of the branch, the nest is large and high; if in a fork,\\r\\nthen it is a more shallow structure; in each case the opening is as\\r\\nperfect a circle as the nature of the materials will admit: the height\\r\\nvaries from two inches to three inches and a quarter, the average\\r\\nbreadth of the opening is about one inch and three-quarters, and the\\r\\ndepth one inch. The eggs are generally three in number, somewhat round\\r\\nin form, and of a greenish white spotted and blotched all over with\\r\\number brown, yellowish brown, and obscure markings of purplish grey;\\r\\ntheir medium length is nine lines and breadth seven lines.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe weight of this bird is nearly three ounces and three-quarters; the\\r\\nstomach is muscular, and those examined contained the remains of\\r\\ndipterous and coleopterous insects.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe note is a loud piping whistle frequently repeated.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe male has the lores deep velvety black; all the upper surface, wings,\\r\\ntail and breast of a rich deep blackish green with a metallic lustre;\\r\\nprimaries deep brown; under surface of the shoulder, abdomen and under\\r\\ntail-coverts white; bill lead-colour at the base, passing into black at\\r\\nthe tip; irides and feet black.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe female, as will be seen on reference to the accompanying Plate,\\r\\ndiffers considerably from the male; the upper surface being much less\\r\\nbrilliant, and the throat and breast of a rich rusty red, a style of\\r\\ncolouring which is also characteristic of the young males during the\\r\\nfirst autumn of their existence.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe figures represent the two sexes of the natural size.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration:\\r\\n\\r\\n  MYIAGRA LATIROSTRIS: _Gould_.\\r\\n\\r\\n  _J.

It is certainly the\\r\\nleast ornamental of the Australian birds, for it is neither\\r\\ngay-coloured, nor is it characterized by any conspicuous markings; these\\r\\ndeficiencies, however, are, as is usually the case, amply compensated\\r\\nfor by the little sombre tenant of the forest being endowed with a most\\r\\ncheerful and pleasing song, the notes of which much resemble, but are\\r\\nmore clear and powerful than the spring notes of the Chaffinch\\r\\n(_Fringilla Cœlebs_), and which are poured forth at the dawn of day from\\r\\nthe topmost dead branch of a lofty gum-tree, an elevated position which\\r\\nappears to be frequently resorted to for the purpose of serenading its\\r\\nmate, its usual place of abode being much nearer the ground. It is\\r\\nmostly met with in pairs, and may be frequently seen perched on the low\\r\\nbushy twigs of a thistle-like plant, occasionally on the gates and\\r\\npalings and in the gardens of the settlers; Mr. Caley states that “it\\r\\nhas all the actions of the British _Robin Red-breast_, except coming\\r\\ninside houses. When a piece of ground was fresh dug it was always a\\r\\nconstant attendant.” It appeared to me that its actions resemble quite\\r\\nas much those of the Flycatchers as of the Robins, and at the same time\\r\\nare sufficiently distinct from either to justify the bird being made the\\r\\ntype of a new genus; I may particularly mention a singular lateral\\r\\nmovement of the tail, which it is continually moving from side to side.\\r\\n\\r\\nIts food consists of insects, which it captures both among the foliage\\r\\nof the trees and on the wing, frequently flying forth in pursuit of\\r\\npassing flies and returning again to the branch it had left.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt generally rears two broods in the course of the year.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe nest, which is built in October, is a slight, nearly flat and very\\r\\nsmall structure, measuring only two inches and a half in diameter by\\r\\nhalf an inch in depth; it is formed of fine fibrous roots, decorated\\r\\nexternally with lichens and small flat pieces of bark, attached by means\\r\\nof fine vegetable fibres and cobwebs; and is most artfully placed in the\\r\\nfork of a dead horizontal branch, whereby it is rendered so nearly\\r\\ninvisible from beneath, that it easily escapes detection from all but\\r\\nthe scrutinizing eye of the aboriginal native. The eggs are generally\\r\\ntwo in number, of a pale greenish blue, strongly marked with dashes of\\r\\nchestnut-brown and indistinct blotches of grey; they are eight and a\\r\\nhalf lines long by five and a half lines broad.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sexes are alike in colour; the young differs from the adult in being\\r\\nmuch paler, and in being spotted with white on the head and back and\\r\\nwith brown on the breast.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe adult has all the upper surface and wings pale brown; wing-coverts\\r\\nslightly tipped with white, and a wash of white on the margins of the\\r\\ntertiaries and tips of the upper tail-coverts; tail dark brown, the\\r\\nexternal feather white, and the next on each side with a large spot of\\r\\nwhite on the inner web at the tip; all the under surface pale brownish\\r\\nwhite, fading into nearly pure white on the chin and abdomen; bill,\\r\\nirides and feet brown.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe figures represent the two sexes of the size of life.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration:\\r\\n\\r\\n  MICRŒCA FLAVIGASTER: _Gould_.\\r\\n\\r\\n  _J.

It gives utterance to many different notes, pouring forth\\r\\nat the dawn of day a strain much resembling that of some of the\\r\\n_Petroicæ_, and like them remaining stationary for a long time while\\r\\ngiving utterance to its very pretty and agreeable melody. In the middle\\r\\nof the day, when the sun is nearly vertical, it leaves the trees and\\r\\nsoars upward in regular circles, like the Skylark, until it arrives at\\r\\nso great a height as to be scarcely perceptible; it then descends\\r\\nperpendicularly until it nearly reaches the trees, when it closes its\\r\\nwings and apparently falls upon the branch on which it alights. During\\r\\nthe whole of this movement it pours forth a song, some parts of which\\r\\nare very soft and melodious, but quite different from that of the\\r\\nmorning; in the evening its song is again varied, and then so much\\r\\nresembles the unconnected notes of the _Gerygones_, that I have\\r\\nfrequently been misled by it. The _Micrœca flavigaster_ is a very\\r\\nfamiliar species, inhabiting the trees and bushes close around the\\r\\nhouses, and is little alarmed or disturbed at the approach of man. At\\r\\ntimes it is extremely pugnacious; I have seen a pair attack a crow and\\r\\nbeat it until it was obliged to seek safety by flight, all the while\\r\\ncalling out most lustily. Notwithstanding it is so abundant everywhere,\\r\\nand it must have been breeding during my stay here, as is proved by my\\r\\nkilling young birds apparently only a few days old, I did not succeed in\\r\\nfinding the nest; and on inquiring of the natives, they could give me no\\r\\ninformation whatever respecting it or the period of incubation.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sexes do not differ in colour or size.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe stomach is tolerably muscular, and the food consists of insects of\\r\\nvarious kinds.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll the upper surface brownish olive; wings and tail brown, margined\\r\\nwith paler brown; throat white; all the under surface yellow; irides\\r\\nblackish brown; feet blackish grey.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe figures are of the natural size.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration:\\r\\n\\r\\n  MONARCHA CARINATA.\\r\\n\\r\\n  _J.

It gives a decided preference to thick brushy\\r\\nforests, such as those at Illawarra and other similar districts\\r\\nextending from the Hunter to Moreton Bay. It is also equally abundant in\\r\\nthe thick brushes which clothe the sloping mountains of the interior.\\r\\nDuring the spring or pairing time it becomes very animated, and is\\r\\ncontinually flying about and beneath the branches of the trees; it does\\r\\nnot capture insects, like the true Flycatchers, on the wing, but obtains\\r\\nthem while hopping about from branch to branch, after the manner of the\\r\\n_Pachycephalæ_. It has a rather loud whistling note, which being often\\r\\nrepeated tends considerably to enliven the woods in which it dwells.\\r\\n\\r\\nI dissected many examples in the bright plumage, all of which proved to\\r\\nbe males, yet I could not fully satisfy myself whether the upper bird in\\r\\nthe Plate is a female, a young bird, or a distinct species; I believe,\\r\\nhowever, that it will prove to be the female.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe _Monarcha carinata_ does not inhabit Van Diemen’s Land or South\\r\\nAustralia; its great nursery is evidently the south-eastern portion of\\r\\nthe country: a distinct but nearly-allied species inhabits the north\\r\\ncoast, of which I have specimens in my collection from the neighbourhood\\r\\nof Cape York.\\r\\n\\r\\nForehead, lores and throat jet-black; all the upper surface grey; wings\\r\\nand tail brown; sides of the neck and the chest light grey; abdomen and\\r\\nunder tail-coverts rufous; bill beautiful light blue-grey, the tip paler\\r\\nthan the base; legs bluish lead-colour; irides black; inside of the\\r\\nmouth greyish blue.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn all probability, the females and the young males of the year are\\r\\ndestitute of the black mark on the face, and the upper figure is that of\\r\\na female or a male in the plumage of the first year.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe figures are of the size of life.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration:\\r\\n\\r\\n  MONARCHA TRIVIRGATA.\\r\\n\\r\\n  _J.

I found it in considerable numbers in every part\\r\\nof the Upper Hunter district, nearly always among the gum-trees, and\\r\\nconstantly uttering a peculiar and not very harmonious strain. Like its\\r\\nnear allies it is very active among the small leafy branches of the\\r\\ntrees, where it searches with the greatest avidity for insects, upon\\r\\nwhich it almost exclusively subsists; resorting for this purpose to\\r\\ntrees of all heights, from the low sapling of two yards high to those of\\r\\nthe loftiest growth.\\r\\n\\r\\nI believe that a species very nearly allied to the present inhabits the\\r\\nnorth coast of Australia: it is very readily distinguished by the\\r\\nmarkings of the tail; and must not be confounded with the bird here\\r\\nrepresented.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have killed young birds in January which had not long left the nest,\\r\\nbut was not so fortunate as to discover the nest itself.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sexes are nearly alike in plumage; but the young of the year are\\r\\ndistinguished from the adult by the throat being of the same colour as\\r\\nthe breast, instead of white.\\r\\n\\r\\nCrown of the head, ear-coverts, and all the upper surface olive-brown;\\r\\nthroat white; chest and all the under surface bright citron-yellow; two\\r\\ncentre tail-feathers brown, the remainder brown at the base, above which\\r\\nis a bar of white, succeeded by a broader one of deep blackish brown;\\r\\nthe tips of all but the two middle ones buffy white on their inner web;\\r\\nbill blackish brown; irides scarlet; feet blackish brown in some\\r\\nspecimens, and leaden brown in others.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe figures represent an adult and a young bird of the year of the\\r\\nnatural size.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration:\\r\\n\\r\\n  GERYGONE FUSCA: _Gould_.\\r\\n\\r\\n  _J.

Descr. of New South\\r\\n            Wales and Van Diemen’s Land, p. 321.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe _Gerygone fusca_ is an inhabitant of New South Wales, where it is to\\r\\nbe found in all the brushes near the coast, as well as in the cedar and\\r\\nother brushes on the sides of the ranges in the interior. As its form\\r\\nwould lead us to imagine, it has much of the habit of the Flycatcher,\\r\\nand lives almost exclusively upon insects, such as aphides and other\\r\\nswift-winged species, which are as frequently taken on the wing as they\\r\\nare on the under sides of leaves, &c. It particularly loves to dwell in\\r\\nthe most retired and gloomy part of the forest, among the creeping\\r\\nBignonias, &c., and is a most active and lively little bird, flitting\\r\\nabout from branch to branch; sometimes, like the true Flycatchers,\\r\\nreturning again to the same branch, and at others hanging to the smaller\\r\\nbranches and scrutinizing the under sides of the leaves, after the\\r\\nmanner of the _Acanthizæ_.\\r\\n\\r\\nIts song, which is almost incessantly poured forth, is a pleasing,\\r\\ntwittering sound.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe breeding-season comprises the months of September, October and\\r\\nNovember. The nest is a delicate and beautiful structure of a domed\\r\\noblong form, the lower end terminating in a point, with the entrance at\\r\\nthe side near the top covered with a well-formed spout, which completely\\r\\nexcludes both sun and rain from the interior of the nest; it is about\\r\\neight inches in height and ten in circumference; the spout projecting\\r\\nabout two inches, and the entrance being scarcely an inch in diameter.\\r\\nThe body of a nest found in the brushes of the Hunter was composed of\\r\\ngreen moss, mouse-eared lichen, soft wiry grasses, the inner bark of\\r\\ntrees and other materials, and was lined with extremely soft grasses.\\r\\nThe eggs are three in number, and are very similar, both in size and\\r\\ncolour, to those of the _Malurus cyaneus_, being minutely speckled with\\r\\nred on a white ground; they are seven and a half lines long by five and\\r\\na half lines broad.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sexes are alike in colour.\\r\\n\\r\\nCrown of the head, all the upper surface and wings dark fuscous brown,\\r\\nslightly tinged with olive; two centre tail-feathers brown; the\\r\\nremainder white at the base, succeeded by a broad band of deep blackish\\r\\nbrown, round which is a broad stripe of white, which entirely crosses\\r\\nthe outer feathers, but only the inner webs of the remainder, the tips\\r\\npale brown; throat and chest grey; abdomen and under tail-coverts white;\\r\\nbill and feet deep blackish brown; irides bright brownish red.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Plate represents the bird of the natural size.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration:\\r\\n\\r\\n  GERYGONE CULICIVORUS: _Gould_.\\r\\n\\r\\n  _J.

Its food consists wholly of\\r\\naphides and other small insects, which are captured on the wing or from\\r\\noff the flowers; it sometimes traverses the smaller branches, and even\\r\\nthe upright boles of trees, prying about and searching for its prey with\\r\\nthe most scrutinizing care. Its powers of flight are rarely exerted for\\r\\nany other purpose than to convey it from shrub to shrub, and for its\\r\\nlittle sallies in pursuit of insects, much after the manner of the true\\r\\nFlycatchers.\\r\\n\\r\\nIts notes are very varied, being at one time a singing kind of whistle,\\r\\nand at others a somewhat pleasing and plaintive melody; but it has a\\r\\nsingular habit of uttering, when flitting from tree to tree, a\\r\\nsuccession of notes and half-notes, some of which are harmoniously\\r\\nblended, while others are equally discordant, and resemble a person\\r\\nproducing notes at random on an instrument with which he is\\r\\nunacquainted.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is said by the natives to breed in September and October.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe nest is suspended by the top to the extremity of a branch, and is\\r\\nformed of threads of bark, small spiders’ nests, green moss, &c., all\\r\\nfelted together with cobwebs and vegetable fibres, and warmly lined with\\r\\nfeathers; it is about eight inches in length, pointed at the top and at\\r\\nthe bottom, and about nine inches in circumference in the middle; the\\r\\nentrance is a small round hole, about three inches from the top, with a\\r\\nslight projection immediately above it. I did not succeed in procuring\\r\\nthe eggs.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sexes are alike in plumage.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll the upper surface olive-brown; wings brown margined with olive; two\\r\\ncentre tail-feathers brown; the remainder white, crossed by an irregular\\r\\nband of black and tipped with brown, the band upon all but the external\\r\\nfeathers so blending with the brown at the tip that the white between\\r\\nmerely forms a spot on the inner web; lores blackish brown; line over\\r\\nthe eye, throat and chest light grey, passing into buff on the flanks,\\r\\nand into white on the centre of the abdomen and under tail-coverts;\\r\\nirides light reddish yellow; bill and feet black.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Plate represents a male and a female of the natural size.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration:\\r\\n\\r\\n  GERYGONE MAGNIROSTRIS: _Gould_.\\r\\n\\r\\n  _J.

He states that it has a very pleasing but weak piping\\r\\nnote, and occasionally utters a number of notes in slow succession, but\\r\\nnot so much lengthened as those of the _Gerygone culicivorus_ of Swan\\r\\nRiver; like that bird it hovers up and down the smaller branches of the\\r\\ntrees and creeps about the thickets. It is very tame, and scarcely ever\\r\\nflies from the tree upon the approach of an intruder, but sits turning\\r\\nits little head about from side to side until the hand is almost upon\\r\\nit, when it merely hops upon another branch and again quietly looks\\r\\nabout, apparently quite unconcerned.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe stomach is tolerably muscular, and the food consists of small\\r\\ninsects, principally of the soft-winged kinds.\\r\\n\\r\\nA narrow obscure line, commencing at the nostrils and passing over the\\r\\neye, yellowish white; all the upper surface rusty brown; primaries\\r\\nbrown, margined with lighter brown; tail whitish at the base, gradually\\r\\ndeepening into nearly black, the lateral feather largely, and the\\r\\nremainder, except the two middle ones, slightly tipped with white; all\\r\\nthe under surface white, slightly washed with yellow; irides light\\r\\nreddish brown; bill olive-brown; base of lower mandible light ash-grey;\\r\\nfeet dark greenish grey.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe figures represent the two sexes of the natural size.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration:\\r\\n\\r\\n  GERYGONE CHLORONOTUS: _Gould_.\\r\\n\\r\\n  _J.

Soc., Part X. p. 133.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThis species is an inhabitant of the northern parts of Australia: it is\\r\\ntolerably abundant at Port Essington, where it dwells among the\\r\\nextensive beds of mangroves which stretch along the coast. It is of a\\r\\nvery shy and retiring disposition, and as the colouring of its back\\r\\nassimilates very closely to that of the leaves of the mangroves, it is a\\r\\nvery difficult bird to sight as it creeps about among the thick branches\\r\\nin search of insects, upon which it solely subsists. In form and in most\\r\\nof its habits and economy it offers some difference from the typical\\r\\nmembers of the genus _Gerygone_, and it would be no great stretch of\\r\\npropriety to assign to it a new generic appellation: the more lengthened\\r\\nform of its legs, the more rigid structure of its primaries, and the\\r\\nlesser development of the bristles at the gape, are among the points in\\r\\nwhich it differs from the _Gerygone fuscus_ of the brushes of New South\\r\\nWales. The latter feeds upon the smallest kinds of gnats and other soft\\r\\ninsects which it captures in the air; on the other hand, the structure\\r\\nof the present bird would lead us to infer that the insects it feeds\\r\\nupon are procured either on the leaves or about the branches.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sexes are so precisely similar in plumage, and differ so little in\\r\\nsize, that dissection must be resorted to to distinguish the one from\\r\\nthe other.\\r\\n\\r\\nHead and back of the neck brownish grey; back, wing-coverts, rump, upper\\r\\ntail-coverts, margins of the primaries, and the margins of the basal\\r\\nhalf of the tail-feathers bright olive-green; primaries and\\r\\ntail-feathers brown, the latter becoming much darker towards the\\r\\nextremity; under surface white; sides and vent olive-yellow; irides\\r\\nwood-brown; upper mandible greenish grey; lower mandible white; feet\\r\\nblackish grey.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Plate represents the two sexes of the natural size.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration:\\r\\n\\r\\n  SMICRORNIS BREVIROSTRIS: _Gould_.\\r\\n\\r\\n  _J.

While searching for insects, in which it is incessantly engaged,\\r\\nit displays all the scrutinizing habits of the _Pari_ or Tits, clinging\\r\\nabout the finest twigs of the outermost branches, prying underneath and\\r\\nabove the leaves and among the flowers, uttering all the while or very\\r\\nfrequently a low simple song. I found it abundant in every part of South\\r\\nAustralia I visited, particularly in the neighbourhood of Adelaide and\\r\\nin the gulleys of the ranges skirting the belts of the Murray; in New\\r\\nSouth Wales it was frequently seen at Yarrundi, and other parts of the\\r\\nUpper Hunter district. Mr. Gilbert states that in Western Australia he\\r\\nonly met with it in the York district, that it was always seen on the\\r\\nbranches of trees, where it feeds on larvæ and small insects, that its\\r\\nflight was of very short duration, merely flitting from tree to tree,\\r\\nand that its note is a weak twitter, a good deal resembling that of the\\r\\n_Acanthiza chrysorrhœa_.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt breeds in September and the two following months, and forms a nest of\\r\\nthe downy buds of plants, mixed with green moss, the cocoons of spiders,\\r\\n&c., all matted and bound together very firmly and closely with spiders’\\r\\nwebs, and the inside lined at the bottom with feathers; it is globular\\r\\nin form, and is attached by the back part to an upright branch, with the\\r\\nentrance in the side, the upper part over the entrance being carried out\\r\\nto a point which shades the opening like the eaves of a house. The eggs\\r\\nare three in number, of a dull buff, marked with extremely fine freckles\\r\\nat the larger end; they are six and a half lines long by four and a half\\r\\nlines broad.\\r\\n\\r\\nA narrow stripe of yellowish white passes from the bill over each eye;\\r\\ncrown of the head brownish grey, passing into olive at the back of the\\r\\nneck; back, rump and upper tail-coverts olive, brightest on the latter;\\r\\near-coverts and sides of the face very pale reddish brown; throat and\\r\\nchest white tinged with olive, with a faint longitudinal mark of brown\\r\\ndown the centre of each feather, the remainder of the under surface pale\\r\\ncitron-yellow; two centre tail-feathers brown; the remainder brown at\\r\\nthe base, the middle being crossed by a broad band of blackish brown,\\r\\nwhich is succeeded by a spot of white on the inner webs, the tips pale\\r\\nbrown; feet blackish brown; irides pale straw-yellow; bill varying from\\r\\nfleshy white to ashy grey.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe figures represent the two sexes, which are similar in plumage, of\\r\\nthe natural size.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration:\\r\\n\\r\\n  SMICRORNIS FLAVESCENS: _Gould_.\\r\\n\\r\\n  _J.

From the circumstance of\\r\\nits confining itself exclusively to the topmost branches of the trees,\\r\\nit is not easily procured, its diminutive size preventing its being\\r\\nseen.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is no outward difference in the sexes, either in plumage or in\\r\\nmagnitude. Future research, and a longer sojourn in the country than has\\r\\nhitherto been afforded for the investigation of the natural productions\\r\\nof those distant parts, are requisite to determine whether it be\\r\\nmigratory or not, and to procure correct information respecting its\\r\\nnidification.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll the upper surface bright yellowish olive; the feathers of the head\\r\\nwith an indistinct line of brown down the centre; wings brown; tail\\r\\nbrown, deepening into black near the extremity, and with a large oval\\r\\nspot of white on the inner web near the tip of all but the two central\\r\\nfeathers; all the under surface bright yellow.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Plate represents the two sexes of the natural size.\\r\\n\\r\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n                          TRANSCRIBER’S NOTES\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n 1.

Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable\\r\\neffort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread\\r\\nworks not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project\\r\\nGutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm\\r\\nelectronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may\\r\\ncontain \"Defects,\" such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate\\r\\nor corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other\\r\\nintellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or\\r\\nother medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or\\r\\ncannot be read by your equipment.\\r\\n\\r\\n1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the \"Right\\r\\nof Replacement or Refund\" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project\\r\\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project\\r\\nGutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project\\r\\nGutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all\\r\\nliability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal\\r\\nfees.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\\r\\n\\r\\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\\r\\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\\r\\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\\r\\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\\r\\nfrom people in all walks of life.\\r\\n\\r\\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\\r\\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\\'s\\r\\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\\r\\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\\r\\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\\r\\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future\\r\\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\\r\\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\\r\\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at\\r\\nwww.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg\\r\\nLiterary Archive Foundation\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\\r\\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\\r\\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\\r\\nRevenue Service. The Foundation\\'s EIN or federal tax identification\\r\\nnumber is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary\\r\\nArchive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by\\r\\nU.S. federal laws and your state\\'s laws.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Foundation\\'s principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the\\r\\nmailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its\\r\\nvolunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous\\r\\nlocations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt\\r\\nLake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to\\r\\ndate contact information can be found at the Foundation\\'s web site and\\r\\nofficial page at www.gutenberg.org/contact\\r\\n\\r\\nFor additional contact information:\\r\\n\\r\\n    Dr. Gregory B. Newby\\r\\n    Chief Executive and Director\\r\\n    gbnewby@pglaf.org\\r\\n\\r\\nSection 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\\r\\nLiterary Archive Foundation\\r\\n\\r\\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\\r\\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\\r\\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\\r\\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\\r\\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\\r\\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\\r\\nstatus with the IRS.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\\r\\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\\r\\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\\r\\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\\r\\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\\r\\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\\r\\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\\r\\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\\r\\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\\r\\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\\r\\napproach us with offers to donate.\\r\\n\\r\\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\\r\\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\\r\\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\\r\\n\\r\\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\\r\\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\\r\\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\\r\\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\\r\\n\\r\\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.\\r\\n\\r\\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\\r\\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\\r\\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\\r\\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\\r\\nvolunteer support.\\r\\n\\r\\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\\r\\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\\r\\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\\r\\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\\r\\nedition.\\r\\n\\r\\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search\\r\\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\\r\\n\\r\\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\\r\\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\\r\\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\\r\\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\\r\\n\\r\\n'"
