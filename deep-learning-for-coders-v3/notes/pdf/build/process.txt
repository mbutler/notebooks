# install build tools:

- prince: https://www.princexml.com/download/
- pandoc: https://pandoc.org/installing.html

# clone repo
git clone https://github.com/hiromis/notes
cd notes

# make pdfs in 2 stages (pandoc fails to create pdfs directly on most Lesson*md files)
for f in *.md; do \
pandoc -s $f -o ${f%.md}.html; \
prince -s pdf/build/prince.css --no-author-style -o ${f%.md}.pdf ${f%.md}.html;
done

adjust the path to ../prince.css, depending on where you are - can put it together with *mds then just ./prince.css

# combine into one (needs java8) (optional)
# install pdfsam: https://pdfsam.org/downloads/
# combine:
# JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk-amd64 pdfsam
# load the Lesson*pdf and merge them
