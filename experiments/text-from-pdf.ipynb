Carroll, Past Grandmaster IOT Pact. \\nWe always advise our neophytes and initiates NOT to wake the Elder Gods, knowing full well that the best of them will rise to the bait and do so. The darkside glamour exerts a \\n\\npowerful charisma which every magician s\\nhould explore and understand. Since the dawn of history the training of sorcerers and sh\\namans has included a \\'harrowing of hell\\', a \\nknowledge and power quest into the subconscious underworld of unspeakable desires and fears, and for good reason. Any repressed desi\\nre will claw its way out of the dungeon at \\nan inappropriate time or at an unguarded mo\\nment if left unacknowledged and unsolved. Thus religious people have a propensity to commit exactly those enormities which their \\n\\nreligion specifically forbids. \\n\\n \\nWe off - white chaoists forbid nothing on moral grounds alone. \\'Nothing is True\\', and \\n\\'Everything is Permitted\\', as we say, not forgetting that \\'The consequences can be \\n\\nGhastly\\'. To those exploring the darkside we\\n can only advise ‚Do what ever you can get away with\\' and monitor the conditions of your \\nmaterial existence as a guide. If you find \\nyourself becoming more powerful, wealthie\\nr, and sexier then press on. If you find yourself shunned, impoverished, imprisoned, or \\ndead, then perhaps a change of course suggests itself. Darkside magic \\noffers a short and dangerous path to triumph or disaster, \\nmore usually the latter, \\nso proceed with care. \\n \\nConsider this introduction as a brief pause in the antechamber to hell. If you choose to \\nembrace and live the cthonic murk and stygian\\n darkness of the following chapters you \\nwill certainly get some return on your investme\\nnt of belief, for it has been well crafted by \\na master. You may learn much about your va\\nrious selves that you would have been happier not knowing. You may even find a wa\\ny through the darkside labyrinth to an effective mastery of the mysteries \\nof darkness and daemonic psychology and \\nparapsychology. Many have tried, most have failed. Do not even think about proceeding unless you have already equipped yourself with a very robust and versatile sense of humor. Take a flight recorder \\nwith you, if only in the form of\\n a fire proof diary, so that others may learn from your mistakes. \\n\\n \\nChaos proved to be a playful and  rewarding  lover who, despite being capricious, was never spiteful. Hail Eros! Darkness promises \\nmuch but does not always deliver. Beware \\nof the pale Hecate. Create your Gods with car\\ne, for they will reform you in their own \\nimage. Peter J. Carroll, 1999 \\n\\n     \\n   5 5 PREFACE  During the past several years I have seen many publications arise concerning vampirism \\nand sorcery, most of the time having no conn\\nection with each other. The Darkside of \\nMagick holds many treasures for those who woul\\nd drink of its cup. I have worked in the occult since I was very \\nyoung, it is very much a natural thing to me, \\nand the connections between the topics of vampirism and sorcery were made known to me\\n at an early age through my dreams. At a \\nlater age I actually made a ma\\ngickal connection, the result of this study in print is the Book of the Witch Moon. This is meant to \\nbe a study guide to the night side, a non-Christian dogma infested approach. The method\\ns of Witchcraft within this tome are of \\nthe darkest magick, when vampires, werewolv\\nes and sorcerers haunted the nights, doing their work and weaving webs in your dreams. We are still there, alive in your mythologies, alive in your mind. \\n\\n \\nWhat is Witchcraft in essence?\\n Is Witchcraft the worship of \\nnature, an earth religion? Not \\ncompletely. The tradition, which I have studied \\nthrough and learnt, is the darker side of \\nWitchcraft, far more dangerous than traditional Wiccan rites however the results are \\n\\nmuch greater.  Do not fear the darkness of the self; let it guide you through the shadows to the light of Prometheus! \\n\\n \\nThis work is meant as an \\ninspirational guide, through which the individual can gain access to the subconscious and the vast res\\nources of the mind and its elementals. \\nWitchcraft is presented in a different form than\\n what most perceive, to this to add as an \\n‚alternative™ to modern Wicca although not condemning it. Hold no tradition which \\n\\nwould bind you, for the Witch blood speaks to th\\nose who remain of a faith all - their - own. Question, Become. Let nothing stand in your way.  \\n\\n \\nThe Author and the Publisher accept no responsibili\\nty for any misuse of any ritual or text \\ncontained herein. Painted in these pages are words of dark power, given command through the mind and its vast abyss of vision a\\nnd knowledge. Be ever so cautious in your explorations and be sure you are ready for the shadows of your own mind, as well as any \\nouter spiritual forces which may enter your\\n life. Asmodeus and Lilith are waiting. \\n \\nThis book is part personal record and part map, a way towa\\nrds the dark essence of the Qlippoth, and of the lore of ages. It is dangerous in it™s methods of dealing with such \\nforces as they are demonic or the more ba\\nlanced counter spelling ‚Daemonic™ (neutral \\nspirit intelligences or elementals which hol\\nd their own godlike association not associated \\nwith any dogma™s such as ‚good™ or ‚evil™. \\nThe great opening of the Abyss is encoded within the Grimoire, ope\\nn and enter with care.  \\nOur basis is to establish a thought process ushering forth in this upcoming age based on \\nbalance and ancient values. Th\\ne subconscious must be explored on numerous levels to \\nunderstand what is known as the beast within. We do not wish to throw in a new religion, or claim something amazing or\\n revolutionary. This book was conceived after a great personal undertaking which involved the Goddess BABALON, for which opened the \\n  6 6 gates of Hecate and Lilith. This work is seen by me personally as a manifestation and gift \\nfor these forces, which both myself and Elda Isela continue to work with. Our approach \\n\\ntowards Witchcraft is based in nature, that \\neach Sabbath is a time of tuning ourselves in \\nwith its tides and changes as well as reaffirming our paths and sorceries. \\n\\nThe Sethanic/Luciferian path is founded at least with the version we provide as one of many paths, that in this definition the \\nidea of Chaos Magick comes to mind. The \\nworkings of the Witch Moon are of the Left\\n Hand Path, gathering hidden knowledge for the development of the individual and the \\nalchemical process of self-deification.  \\nThe work of Austin Osman Spare is of particular interest; being that what is called the \\nZos Kia Cultus itself holds a gateway worth exploring and developing upon, building and expanding it by every living breath, opening the vortex of the mind towards the current of \\nwitch blood that waits beyond. \\n \\nWhat we are offering is a system base\\nd on Witches Sabbat/Sethanic/Luciferian \\nWitchcraft and The Zos Kia Cultus. The pr\\nimal aspect of Vampirism (spelled also \\nVampyrism) plays a significant role in the expl\\noration of the self in it\\'s lunar phase. You \\nwill notice the varied topics discussed, I find ea\\nch relevant towards the proper training of \\na magickian. Topics as Yoga, Cabalistic lore, \\nChaos, Sethian Witchcraft and the Zos Kia \\nCultus all holds a great line \\nfeeding each gnosis. Take from it what you will but never \\nsacrifice hard work and hard training for an easy out. Once such a mistake is made, your \\n\\nvery self is fodder for Choronzon. A final no\\nte: Approach the Sorcery outlined in these \\npages through the art, it is a key to much more that awaits those who turn the key. \\n \\n \\n   \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n   7 7 Chapter One Vampyrism, Lycanthropy and the Dead \\n Vampirism and lycanthropy, a fleshing or ma\\nnifestation of daemonic energies. The \\nshadowside has long been hidden from the ba\\nsic study of magick on any serious level. \\nThe inherent goal of magick is\\n to awaken and explore the se\\nlf, progression, evolution and individual power. This is gained from firs\\nt hand experience and study. The path of the \\nsorcerer is never an easy or safe one, \\nmany of the greatest dangers exist in the \\nsubconscious realm. \\n\\nVampirism has existed and grown in the Eu\\nropean psyche for generations, stretching \\nsome thousands of years. The same is true \\nwith lycanthropy, shape shifting and the darker aspects of witchcraft. Lycanth\\nropy is closely connected with\\n the dual aspects of sex and \\ndeath, as is vampirism. The lunar current wh\\nich the sorcerer opens\\n and becomes aligned \\nwith is based on the as\\npect of hidden desire and lustfu\\nl atavisms which manifest in the \\nspirit and form of a wolf, ow\\nl, cat and other such animal. \\nLycanthropy can be a useful \\nexercise and individual \\npower points which can be used e\\nffectively on the astral plane. \\nThis book is meant as a Grimoire\\n for the balanced sorcerer. \\nThe purpose of this being to \\noffer further guidance and present a serious \\nform of shadow magick and sorcery which \\nhas long been kept hidden. The black art is\\n not that of devil worship, but of hidden \\nknowledge. The key to this lies in the depths \\nof the subconscious, the will to explore and \\nsuggest, to destroy and create. \\nThe daemonic elementals which breed in the subconscious mind from the time of birth \\n\\nand on can be banished and often made useful \\nto the fighting individual. There is no devil worship or ill intent involved for the worker \\nof Shadow magick, it is up to the individual \\nwhich path they take. I have always intende\\nd, from the beginning to\\n present balance and \\ninsight into a dangerous psychic \\npath. That of the shadow sor\\ncerer is not that of mental \\nweakness; however it often tests the mind on \\never possible level. Questions, answers, \\nfears and pain await those who explore. Fear \\nnot however, without the trials of life there \\nis no true knowledge or expe\\nrience. It is through consci\\nously and willfully exploring \\nareas of ourselves- an\\nalyze and become stronger because \\nof it.  Devoid of this, there \\nwould be no great pleasure of life, no reward\\n for hard work and no \\npoint of building the \\ngreatest strength of all - That of the mind! \\nPresented in this Grimoire is a formula of\\n Magickal growth, which, if practiced under \\nwill and with a sound mind will aw\\naken a great Beast willing \\nit\\'s flesh and spirit on the \\n  8 8 earth. Demons do exist, however it is not al\\nways their intent to harm innocent humans. \\nOur point is to destroy AND create. \\nThe magick in these pages is of all colors, \\nbeing that of significant power. Law perceived \\nas going forth by night and day, creating with \\nlove and joy and the destruction of that \\nwhich is ill. The manifestation of both the Bl\\nack and Red temple (that of death and sexual \\nmagick). There is no evil in the heart  for the essence lives intently on it\\'s message. Every \\n\\nman and every woman have their animalistic \\nurges, from which At\\navisms develop and \\nexist. We are throwing open the gates of Saturn (the\\n gates of Death, hidde\\nn knowledge), they \\nare the resurgent atavisms, the hidden spir\\nits and archetypes of\\n shadow and night, the \\nblack sun shining with life and wisdom - the Torch bearer (1 ) behind the darkness. Love, health, wisdom and beauty are the fine\\nst forms of existence. The shadows in the \\nnight which glow under the moon exist to da\\nnce with you, to guide towards a glimpse of \\nthe Night of Pan, to gather on the astral plan\\ne at the Witches\\' Sabbath. Come close, if \\nyour will is against it much is deadly, howev\\ner with pleasure and the glowing lamp of \\nstrength all is possible. \\nCome within the night side\\n, where Varcolaci await....   Vampirism, Lycanthropy and European Folklore  For thousands of years there have been tale\\ns of beasts haunting the countryside by night, \\ndemons which stalk the roads and pathways\\n of the forests. Corpses who enter the \\nchambers of the sleeping for \\nsexual congress. The wild hunt\\n which rides the Northern \\nskies in the Autumn, searching for soul\\ns to join their ghastly celebrations. \\nThe undead in European folklore are immensely strong and colorful in their legend. \\n\\nWalking corpses known as Draugr, which is \\ndescribed as an animated corpse which \\ncrawls from its own grave mound to haunt the \\nnight and its prudent \\nfolk. Draugr was one \\nof the main undead that existed in Icelandic \\nfolklore, the creature would always incarnate \\nin it\\'s old flesh or the flesh of some dead \\nnear it. The term ghost w\\nould often be used to \\ndescribe it, despite it\\'s manifestation in a d\\nead body. The Draugr was sa\\nid as well to have \\nthe psychic powers of foreseeing the future, \\ncontrolling weather (which other vampiric \\nbeings and witches always seemed to have \\ncontrol over) and shape shifting.  In  Norse \\nmythology the belief in such creatures is freque\\nntly encountered. It so seemed that these \\nbeings were spawn of Hel (2), of which ma\\nny could not escape from their graves and \\nexisted in a similar way to central Europ\\nean Nosferatu, Nachzehrer and so on. Such \\ncreatures in Norse mythology were called \"hau\\ngbui\" which translates to \"barrow\", being \\nmound dweller. \\nGermany holds a large amount of folklore\\n relating to Vampirism and Lycanthropy, \\nAustria has the demonic Perchten, the British \\nIsles the female vampires Glaistigs. Much \\nhas grown from such legends and myths, some \\nof which is truth and some of which is \\nsomething beyond. Symbolism is of great sign\\nificance in magick because the individual \\nseeks to enter, take hold and mo\\nld the clay of life around him/her. \\nGermany gives us the vampire races of N\\nachzehrer, Nachttoter, Alp, Neuntoter and \\nNosferatu. \\n   9 9 Nachzehrer is a vampire which is found in\\n the northern part of Germany and the \\nKashubes, which include Bavaria and other su\\nrrounding areas. The Nachzehrer is born in \\nthe coffin under the light of the moon, it awakes and begi\\nns tearing it\\'s own flesh. This \\nvampire is able to contact its living family members on the astral plane, guiding them into \\n\\nits own feeding. When the Nachzehrer was exhu\\nmed, it was found to be \\nresting in its own blood and a half devoured grave shroud. A pecu\\nliar thing about the \\nNachzehrer is that \\nthis creature sleeps with it\\'s left eye open and \\nholding it\\'s thumb. It was not rare that this \\ncreature would begin to eat its own flesh. When the Nachzehrer would leave it™s tomb\\n it would sometimes climb the tower of a \\nchurch. The demon would then \\nring the bells in the dead \\nof night, which was said to \\ncause death to any who would \\nbe unfortunate enough to hear \\nthe ghostlike callings in the \\nnight. It was the belief in Bavaria that the \\nNachzehrer could be created if an individual \\nwas born with a caul or second skin, an unfor\\ntunate circumstance for many an innocent \\nchild born with such a birth defect. This va\\nmpire was often connected (as with many of \\nit\\'s kind) as holding the powers \\nof plague and pestilence. During times of such sickness many a vamp\\nire hunt would ensue, causing numerous \\ngraves to be exhumed and the corpses defile\\nd by the paranoid town folk. Nachttoter (a \\nmagickal title taken by the author) is a vamp\\nire which translates \"killer in the night\", a \\nbeing which would haunt the dreams of many, pa\\ninting the walls and bed sheets in blood \\nand semen of bestial congress. Neuntoter was give\\nn its title by the belief that it takes nine \\nfull days for the vampire to develop in \\nit\\'s coffin or tomb. Found in Saxony, the \\nNeuntoter was recognized as being \\na severe carrier of the plague. The Alp is a vampire like spir\\nit associated with the incubus\\n/succubus who would torment \\nthe dreams of men, women and ch\\nildren alike. The Alp is considered often to be that of a \\nrecently deceased person, or often a demon of\\n the tomb - that which is bred from the \\ndarkest aspects of magick and the astral plan\\ne. The Alp can take the form of a cat, pig, \\ndog and other creatures such as a werewolf \\nand demonic beasts which resemble rabid, \\nblack dogs. This spirit is also \\nknown to wear a hat and use its powers to fly the night sky. \\nIts methods of feeding include entering the \\nmouth of the victim through a long serpent \\nlike tongue and changing to smoke, wherein it\\n absorbs the life force of the individual. \\nThe Alp is also said to drain blood from \\nthe breast of women, and of men and children \\nthrough their nipples. This incubus proves difficu\\nlt to get rid of as it exists almost \\nexclusively on the astral plane. Very rarely \\nwas it said to manife\\nst anywhere else but \\ndreams. \\n\\nNosferatu (also Slavonic in its basis) is a \\nvampire spirit who haunts the astral plane as \\nwell as the earth. Its bat like appearance\\n exemplifies its predatory qualities. The \\nNosferatu is said to be associated with\\n the incubus and succu\\nbus, indicating its \\nconnection with the astral plane. Once the crea\\nture is buried, it will\\n rise from the grave \\nshortly afterwards, going forth in the night \\nto grow strong on th\\ne blood of the living. \\nMale Nosferatu are said to be able to impre\\ngnate women, the children are then destined to \\ncarry on the lineage of its father and beco\\nme a sorcerer and Moroii, giving nightly \\ncommunion of blood to it\\'s parent. \\n\\nRomania and Hungary have significant folklore\\n as well, Hungary being connected with \\nthe Bathory family. Countess Bathory added fuel\\n to the fire of vampire mania in Europe \\nby being caught indulging in her blood lust, k\\nilling and bathing in the blood of over 560 \\ngirls.   10 10 Romania adds yet more strength to the vampir\\ne lore with its colorful races of vampires, \\nbeing Varcolaci (of which Coven Nachttot\\ner and the Coven Maleficia  derived \\ninspiration), Dracul, Strigoi and Moroii. \\nVarcolaci is a Romanian vampire spirit. This particular vampire spirit is generally a \\n\\nliving individual, going forth \\nin a presumably normal life. In the night however this \\nvampire would physically enter sleep and it\\ns spirit would rise \\nas what was called \\nVarcolaci.  The undead spirit is able to rise\\n towards the night sky, in the form of a small \\ndragon or wolf with many heads, to drink \\nblood from the moon. The Varcolaci are also \\nable to haunt villages and drain astral life force and blood from the sleeping. The Varcolaci vampire is quite powerful on the as\\ntral plane, being able\\n to haunt the night \\nin many forms, depending on the primal urge\\n and desire. Further explanations and \\ndevelopments of this form are discussed in \\nlater chapters of this\\n book. Dracul or Dracula \\nis Romanian meaning \"Son of the Dragon\" \\nand can also mean \"Son of the Devil\". \\nDracula is known as Vlad Tepes, a Roma\\nnian noble man who lived from 1431 to 1476 \\nand protected the Transylvanian country side\\n with terror and honor. Vlad was known as \\nthe \"impaler Prince\" for his use of impalement\\n and torture. His modern tactics of war and \\nsubterfuge proved him to be a successful wa\\nr lord and Prince. His war with the Turks \\nlasted his life and gave birth to\\n many tales of his vampiric \\nactions and violence. An order \\nhe belonged to, The Order of the Dragon, wa\\ns a defense against the Turkish offensive that was rumored to involve magical activities. \\n\\nStrigoi is represented as an undead vampire sp\\nirit, sometimes female and also a kin to the \\nword strigoica, meaning \"witch\". It is the \\nMoroii, who are often Varcolaci themselves, \\nwho meet the Strigoi \\nin the night and give communion of\\n blood and other lustful unions \\nof demonic passion. \\n\\nThe individual, who seeks to explore and envelop the self within the shadows of vampiric \\nsorcery, must be willing to become as those \\nnocturnal archetypes which hide within their \\nsubconscious. You must embrace that within yo\\nur deepest self, which is ever changing. \\nIn other words, take upon your conscious what\\n is fitting to your \\npersonality and self. Vampirism and Lycanthropy is the most danger\\nous path to take on magickally, as it \\ninvites the dark arms of the Black Ea\\ngle and Thanatos. Proceed with caution. When I began focusing on the archetypes a\\nnd symbols of vampirism I began drawing \\nconnections to the system of shape shifti\\nng according to the na\\nture of the vampire \\npresented. For example, a tale of female vamp\\nires would give them the astral form of a \\ncat, an owl or raven. Many male \\nvampires would take the astr\\nal assumption of a wolf or \\nbat. It was said that vampires\\n may take the form of mist \\nor fog, this connection obviously \\ncomes from the ability to assume\\n a mist form on the astral pl\\nane. If certain points of chi \\ncan be strengthened into a viable physical ener\\ngy then one can view th\\ne astral in the form \\nof the chosen focus. Most often, this is s\\neen in dreams or mentally open times depending \\non the individual thoughts and mind set. \\n\\nThrough the past 600 years of vampiric hist\\nory, many women and me\\nn would wake from \\na seemingly restful sleep, still feeling exha\\nusted and worn out. Th\\neir experience from \\ndreaming would be disturbed or reminis\\ncent of a waning sexua\\nl experience with a \\ndemonic or angelic being. It is possible to de\\nvelop, out of inherited \\nand personal traits, an independent predatory instinct which can \\nfunction on \"autopilot\" while dreaming. Then \\nthat the hunter may seek out unconsciously t\\nhose who have imprinted on the astral plane \\ntheir wishes of congregation and lust. Many \\nhave developed from personal experience \\n  11 11 (ie. childhood or early life trauma) a pred\\natory complex which w\\nould act itself out from \\nfrustration during the dream state. The main\\n difference between a serial killer and a \\ndreamer is the killer takes his/her desires ou\\nt on flesh instead of\\n a subconscious dream \\nsituation. Such an individual would lack se\\nlf control and the need for balance and \\nunderstanding.  For the sorcerer, \\nit is known that natural inst\\nincts of hunting and survival \\nare not to be repressed and ignored, but ra\\nther should be explor\\ned and understood, for a \\nsignificant part of the individuals make up lies in those hidden corridors. The Lycanthropic strain of humanity lies in \\nits hidden urges and prim\\nal desires. English \\nsorcerer and artist Austin Osman Spare (3) br\\nilliantly structured a \\nsystem based on belief \\nand loose bonds. Atavistic resurg\\nence is the act of \\nbringing forth primal desires via the \\nsubconscious, wherein such desires manifest an\\nd sometimes breed into monsters. It is up \\nto the individual to build a great amount of\\n strength to confront, understand and control \\nsuch energies. Many lycanthropic urges manife\\nst in violent sexual activity, wherein all \\nhonesty is present and a pure \\naspect of psychic make up \\nis understood. Blood and sexual \\ncongress have long been interpreted as anim\\nalistic lust, resulti\\nng in the creation of \\npsychic bonds between the individuals invol\\nved. Countess Elizabeth Bathory (4) often \\nwould stick pins and cut the flesh of her young \\nvictims after beating them almost to the \\npoint of unconsciousness. Blood baths would pr\\novide the Countess with the ease of her \\nown obsession with staying young and her subconscious desire for the blood of youth. One tale set in the northw\\nest of England involved a vampiric spirit known as the \\nNightstalker of Croglin Grange. A family \\nmoved into an abandoned home located right \\nnext to a very old graveyard. The young wo\\nman, who lived there with her brothers, \\nretired to bed one evening. She glanced out\\n of her window to \\nnotice two red eyes gleaming in the darkness, moving around graves\\ntones and through the yard. She then lost \\nsight of it and in puzzlement went to sleep. \\nShe awoke some time later to a scratching at \\nthe window, in fear she froze, not being able \\nto scream or even move. The vampire then \\ntore away the lead of the window\\n pane until the glass crashed \\nto the floor. \\nA necrotically gray hand reached in towards her and entered \\nher chamber. She fell under its spell as the \\ndemon drew closer to her. The being was pale and thin, almost skeleton like... its mouth \\n\\nand eyes were crimson red; she felt an overwhelming sense of fear and even lust. \\n  12 12 At some point she was able to regain her \\nsenses and scream aloud for help. Once her \\nbrothers reached her bed chamber and entere\\nd they found their sister lying on the bed, \\nblood pulsating from her \\n\\nthroat and the white sheets \\n\\ncovered in burgundy. There \\n\\nwas no one present in the \\n\\nroom, save the ghostly wind \\n\\nwhich blew through the \\n\\ncold room, from which no \\n\\nwindow pane kept out the \\n\\nnight air. \\nThe werewolf has long been \\n\\nassociated with vampirism \\n\\nin European folklore. It is \\n\\nafter all, the vampire which \\n\\nis able to shape shift into \\n\\nsuch a wolf like beast \\n\\ncovered in gray or black \\n\\nfur, gleaming red or yellow \\n\\neyes and enormous, cruel \\n\\nfangs. \\n \\nThe wolf form can be \\n\\nassumed in one of two \\n\\nexternal shapes, being a \\n\\nlarge hunting wolf or a \\ngiant man-wolf form, which \\nproves to be a mental and \\n\\nphysical terror. One of the \\n\\nfirst werewolves, Lycon, \\nwas turned into a wolf by \\n\\nZeus in a form of \\n\\npunishment for a crime. In \\n\\nScandinavia, werewolves \\n\\nwere regarded as great \\n\\nwarriors who fought for \\n\\ntheir land and family honor. \\n\\nThe werewolf was not one \\nin the actual form of a wolf, however, but a \\nNorseman covered in the skin of a bear or \\nwolf. They would attain a ment\\nal-shamanistic balance of beast and with a mind sigil of \\nOdin and Wotan ascend to the battle which wo\\nuld last to the deat\\nh. Their ferocity was \\nlegendary and these warriors, who had no one\\n sided concepts of good or evil, found a \\nbalance for the love of thei\\nr culture and family. They fought in harmony with nature. \\nThere was however a shadowside within their \\nculture: the great demon-wolf Fenrir which \\ndevoured the sun; and the woods of \"Jarnskoga\\nrna\", which were feared because of the \\n  13 13 supposed werewolf tribes there, which were \\nled by Mane-Garm, they too were said to \\ndevour the sun. \\nThis was due to Mane-Garm\\'s everlasting \\nhunger for flesh and power. Many werewolves \\nof this culture had titles as Sinfjotle (he \\nwith yellow paws), Hjarulv (sword wolf) and \\nKveldulf (evening wolf). \\nIt is possible for one to assume the form \\nof the wold during as\\ntral projection. The \\ntransformation on the astral plane permits in\\ntensely surreal experiences. The hunt in the \\ndead of night is one of the most significan\\nt of htese experiences. Details on lycanthropic \\ntransformation are given later in this book. \\n\\nThe wolf girdle would often give the individu\\nal the power to alter his/her form into a \\nbeast. This method, which would require an \\natavism working, would cause the individual \\nto feel a large shadow move within him/he\\nr and become one with their mind. The beast \\nwould transform the flesh and spirit into\\n an enormous wolf, hungering for blood and \\nflesh... for the hunt. During the period of such \\ntransformations, as I can personally attest, \\ntracking or traveling in great fo\\nrests or through fields is a be\\nneficial experience. The wolf \\nis an excellent hunter,\\n able to travel long \\nperiods without rest and to move virtually \\nsoundlessly in the night. It is known that the wo\\nlf can run up to fifteen miles an hour for \\nthe period of roughly three hours or more. It is\\n not rare for a wolf to cover up to one \\nhundred miles a day when food is scar\\nce during a brutal winter or such.  \"Werewolves in European History\"  The werewolf can exist on the physical plane as well as the astral one. The main \\n\\ndifference is the form, on the physical plane th\\ne wolf attributes are mental, consisting of \\nheightened senses and physical strength. Th\\ne face and hands may resemble those of a \\nbeast. \\nIt is useful to call upon such atavisms when one is in a defensive situation or for physical \\n\\nsurvival in the extreme cold. I can recall \\nnumerous times when I had undertaken some \\nearly will training exercises amidst the perils \\nof an extreme winter \\nwhich often threatened my own personal safety. I had to call upon the wolf then just to carry my mind and body \\n\\nto a heightened sense of strength and power. \\nThe werewolf may be invoked with runes or \\nsigils, for which the details are given later in this book. Werewolves and such creatures have existed \\nas long as vampires. In France there were \\n\"Meneurs de loupﬂ which were said to lead\\n wolves by playing a bone pipe which would \\necho the music of the dead. The wolf charmer was by no means a friend of humanity, \\n\\ncausing werewolves and servitors to devour any \\nunfortunate soul who \\nwalk near them in \\nthe night. \\nIn the year 1502 in France there was a peasan\\nt named Pierre Burgot who was tending to \\nthe sheep in his herd. From the woods rode \\nthree men each dressed in black and deathly \\npale. The leader of the men, who called himsel\\nf Moyset, told Pierre that his men would \\nwatch over his herd and give unto him a great \\nfortune if he would obey his wishes. Pierre \\nagreed and in their next m\\neeting Moyset inquired upon Pierre\\n\\'s religious \\nbeliefs. Upon \\nfinding that Pierre was one who accepted Chris\\ntianity he commanded him to reject Jesus \\nChrist, the holy virgin and his baptism. Bur\\ngot then accepted his suggestions and gave an \\noath by kissing Moysets\\' hand, which was as co\\nld as the hand of a corpse. It was years \\nlater when the rider returned and gave Bur\\ngot an ointment to smear upon himself. This \\n  14 14 act was done along with Pierre\\'s friend Verd\\nun, who smeared himself with this foul \\nsmelling ointment as well. The two became wolves and began to devour other humans. \\n\\nMoyset sneered at the two and rode off \\ninto the night. The two were captured and \\nexecuted for their crimes. \\n \\nIn the year 1600 two \\n\\nteenage boys, Jean \\nGrenier and Pierre la \\n\\nTilhaire went into the \\n\\ndense, dark forest to hunt \\n\\nand gather food for their \\n\\nfamilies. They were met \\n\\nat some point by a man \\n\\nupon a black horse who \\n\\ncalled himself Herren or \\n\\nthe Lord of the Forest. \\n\\nHe offered the two \\n\\nteenage boys individual \\n\\npower, based on their \\nwill alone. Once they \\n\\naccepted, Herren, with \\nthe lips of the dead, \\n\\nkissed each forehead of \\n\\nthe two and sealed it by \\n\\ncutting a small sigil in \\n\\nthe form of a crescent \\nmoon on their thighs. Herren then gave each \\n\\nboy a wolfskin belt and \\n\\nan ointment. He then \\n\\ngave to them the verbal \\n\\nritual of lycanthropic \\n\\npower, the strength and \\n\\nsuccess of which \\n\\ndepended on their own \\n\\njudgment and will. He \\n\\ntold each boy to grow \\ntheir left thumbnail long and in the night of\\n full moon to begin invoking the power of the \\nwolf spirit. \\n\\nThe Lord of the Forest (5) then disappeared never to be heard from again. \\n\\nThe two teenagers embarked upon a great ki\\nlling spree, eventual\\nly being caught and \\nexecuted for their murderous acts. \\n\\nPeter Stubb was also a known lycanthrope wh\\no lived in Germany \\nin the 15th century. \\nStubb claimed that the \"devil\" had given him a \\nbelt made of wolf skin ( 6) , which he \\nwould put on and then transform into a wolf. \\nHe murdered numerous people until he was \\ncaught and executed as well. No one ever found the belt made of wolf skin. \\n  15 15 This is an excerpt from a German pamphlet\\n spreading the evils of lycanthropy several \\nhundred years ago. \\n \\n\"Stubb Peeter \\nA True discourse declaring the damnable li\\nfe and death of one Stubb Peeter, A most \\nwicked Sorcerer, who, in the likeness of \\na wolf, committed many murders, continuing \\nthis devilish practice twenty five years, killing and devouring men, women and children. \\nWho, for the same fact was taken and executed the 31\\nst of October, 1589 \\nin the town of \\nBedbug, near the city of Cologne in Germany. \\n\\n\"From the town of Bedburg unto Cologne in\\n upper Germany, there was brought up one \\nStubbe Peeter, who from his youth was greatly in\\nclined to evil. He gave himself to the \\npractice of the wicked arts from age twelve years until his dying day. He gorged himself \\n\\nin the damnable desire of magic, necroman\\ncy and sorcery, acquainting himself with many \\ninfernal spirits and fiends. In the end he sold his soul to the devil in return for a life full of \\ncarnal pleasure. \\nUnlike other accursed men, this vile man sorcer\\ner desired of the devil neither riches nor \\npromotion nor any other outward pleasure. \\nBeing of a most cruel and bloody mind, he \\nrequested that he might work malice on men, \\nwomen and children in the shape of some \\nbeast. Thus he might live without dread \\nor danger of life and be unknown as the \\nperpetrator of those \\nbloody enterprises which he mean\\nt to commit.  Recognizing this \\nwicked fiend as a fit instrument to perform \\nmischief and destructi\\non, the devil gave unto \\nStubbe Peeter a girdle, whic\\nh being put around him transfor\\nmed him forthwith into the \\nlikeness of a devouring wolf.  This demonic wo\\nlf was strong and mighty, with great eyes \\nwhich in the night sparkled like brands of\\n fire. It\\'s body was huge, a great mouth wide \\nwith most sharp and cruel teeth. As soon as he\\n would take off the gi\\nrdle the talons with \\nlong and razor sharp nails would become huma\\nn hands again and would appear as if he \\nhad never changed from human form. \\nStubbe Peeter was herewith exce\\nedingly well pleased with th\\nis form. The form which he \\ncould assume was quite in step with his nature. This demonic gift was in no way \\n\\ntroublesome thing for it was light\\n of weight and hidden easily. He proceeded to execute sundry most hein\\nous and vile murders, for if  any person \\ndispleased him, he would thirst for revenge. \\nNo sooner should his enemies or chosen prey \\nwalk abroad in the fields or about the city, th\\nis vile sorcerer, in th\\ne form of a wolf would \\nstalk them and never rest until he had plucke\\nd out their throats and torn their joints \\nasunder. Before long he had developed such \\na taste for blood, that the shedding thereof \\nbecame his greatest pleasure and delight. Upon \\nsundry time he would then travel through \\nthe streets of Cologne and Bedburg, searching \\nfor victims of his demonic bloodlust. In \\nthose places would Stubbe Peeter walk up and \\ndown until he espied either maid or wife \\nwhich he lusted for. Upon choosing the victim\\n he would draw them out of the city or \\nfollow them, wherein he would ravish them and then, in his wolfish form, cruelly murder \\n\\nthem. Yea, it would often come to pass that as \\nhe walked abroad in \\nthe fields, if he by \\nchance spy a company of maidens playing togeth\\ner, or milking their cows, in his wolfish \\nshape he would run without delay among th\\nem. While the rest escaped by flight, he \\nwould for sure lay hold to one, and once he satis\\nfied his lust he would murder them. It so \\nhappened that he had a daughter, who wa\\ns a fair young damsel by which name was \\nStubbe Beel. She was said to be very beau\\ntiful. Stubbe Beell was also victim of her \\n  16 16 fathers\\' lustful desires, not even she was \\nfree from his perversion and desire. At one \\nlength the devil sent unto Stubbe Peeter \\na succubus, elemental who was in flesh a \\nbeautiful and surreal woman. \\nThis woman was with him fo\\nr seven years, and once her \\npurpose unto Stubbe was served, \\nshe disappeared.  Th\\nis did not falter Stubbe Peeter, he \\ncontinued his lycanthropic changes and began shedding blood each day. \\n\\nThe following matter doth stand as a special note of the wickedness of this abominable \\n\\nsorcerer. \\nHe beheld a proper youth for a son, begotten \\nas a young man. In this lad he took to much \\njoy, commonly calling him his heart\\'s ease. Ye\\nt as he favored his son the beast within \\ntook over and he spilt the blood of his only ma\\nle child. One day he took his son into a \\nfield and told him he would re\\nturn. Suddenly a hulking shadow of a wolf encountered his \\nown son and cruelly slew him. Once the horri\\nd deed was done, the \\nwolf cracked open the \\nskull of the boy and ate his brains. \\nHis career lasted many years, filled with vi\\nolence, murder and devilish lycanthropy and \\nsorcery. \\nSoon the towns of Cologne, Bedburg and Sper\\nad, seeing themselves so grievously \\nendangered, \\nplagued and utterly terrified, ensued upon a hunt of\\n this beast. At last they were able to \\ncatch this beast, who took the wolf girdle \\noff and returned to human form. The hunters \\nthought it was some devil in human form, how\\never they soon learned of his home nearby \\nand that he had lived there for years. He had \\nthen also admitted to killing and sorcery. It \\nwas also found out that his daughter had as\\nsisted her father along with his mistress \\nKatherine Trompin. Their judgments were \\npassed October 28th, 1589 in such manner. \\nStubbe Peeter was tied to a rack and torn \\napart limb from limb on October 31st 1589. His \\ndaughter and mistress we later burnt\\n at the stake the same day.\" \\n It is the goal of the Coven Maleficia  (7) to \\nnot condone violence or harm to others, but to \\npresent the choice of shadow exploration \\nand individual understanding and power. There is no seeking of members, as they are few \\nand hidden, like the dream of blue ice which \\nforms on the windows on a cold \\nnight. There is no set temp\\nle, beyond the individuals who practice upon their own will and desire. Th\\ne result of the misuse of lycanthropic \\npower is always negative to the sorcerer if us\\ned out of the law of \"Do what thou wilt..\".  \\nIn other words if it trespasses \\non another individual\\'s rights \\nof life and joy then it is \\nwrong, unless provoked or within a magickal \\ncombat aspect. Our witch - dreams are \\nwalking in the rows of the night. Forever. \\nAstral vampirism and lycanthropy can be\\n obtained once the Warlock and Witch are \\ncapable and adept in the Witches Sabbat arts\\n. This will demand much in the area of \\ndiscipline, self mastery and will in order to\\n obtain such powers, however, be sure the \\nreward is ten fold for such a development! \\n\\nTales of the Sorcerer who in secrecy leaves his or her flesh to take the form of an animal \\n\\nor vampyre spirit to celebrate the Horned \\nLord or Black God of Illumination and life \\nupon earth will be once again whispered in the \\nhalls of the dead, our kind never died out \\nor went away, we carried our lineal witch \\nblood through the throes of time and space, \\ncovering the earth again in secrecy. \\n  17 17 Yelg Paterson and the greatest \\nof mythical sorcerers exist \\nthrough those who take into \\ntheir essence and mind the very\\n witchblood which passes through \\nastral lineage, to which \\nyour great heritage is all obtainable for your future work.  Chapter Two The Book of Night -Elementals of Mind and Space- \\n Vampiric or \\n‚Vampyric™ Sorcery is a \\n\\ntechnique of evoking \\n\\nand directing energies \\nwhich are Qlipothic in \\nnature and/or origin. \\n\\nThe Kabbalah defines \\nthe Qlipoth as \\nunbalanced or negative \\n\\nenergies which exist \\n\\nbeyond the sphere of \\n\\nDa™ath, which is dual in \\n\\nit\\'s qualities. Da™ath is \\n\\noften represented as a \\n\\npower zone of wisdom, \\n\\nthe hidden knowledge. \\n\\nOne may ask, what is \\n\\nthe key? The KEY is \\n\\nthe subconscious, the \\ndark matter of the \\n\\nbrain. \\n \\nVampyrism is also the \\n\\nWill-directed internal \\n\\nfocus of exploring the \\n\\nimmortal aspects of the \\n\\nVampyre in shadow \\n\\nand dream form. It is a \\n\\nprocess of sinister or \\n\\nleft-handed alchemy, \\n\\nbeing the Adversarial path of Luciferian Self-Development. \\n\\n \\nElementals are different from spirits in that \\nthey will often take the form of desires and \\nwhat we call atavisms, they take the form of\\n urges within the psyc\\nhe and rarely can be \\n  18 18 made to assume visible appearance.  Austin \\nSpare was said to be able to do such at \\ncertain times however his witch mother ‚Yelg™\\n Paterson  was said to do such at will.  \\nDa™ath is guarded by Choronzon, who is regarded as both demon and vampire. Some \\n\\ntexts have presented Choronzon as not a dem\\non at all, however but a guardian of this \\nhidden sphere who is only considered \\'evil\\' due\\n to it\\'s alien nature \\nto conscious or even \\nsubconscious human thought patterns. I am \\npresenting Choronzon as a demon, a vampire \\nspirit. Now am I defining it as \\'evil\\'?, NO. My \\nreasoning is that evil is\\n only a closed term \\ndefining already pre-dogma - ridden thought pattern\\ns, a system within itself. One must go \\nbeyond the gates of  Choronzon into Da™ath in \\norder to begin to understand first, the self \\nand secondly, the exterior universe. \\n \\n \\nOnce one has crossed the Abyss it is then possible to begin to control and shape his or her own individual destiny based on the discovery \\nof the True Will or Holy Guardian Angel. \\nChoronzon is also a vampire sp\\nirit. It can not be\\n evoked or invoked in its entirety. The \\nreason is that Choronzon is all that can\\n invoke madness or dest\\nruction, creation only being possible through summoni\\nng, facing, passing through Da™ath and banishing. This is \\nthe mastering of Choronzon, thus\\n, in essence the end result of\\n controlling a part of this \\nenergy. \\n \\nVampiric Sorcery is the mastery of the elem\\nentals of the deep subconscious. Are all \\nvampire spirits merely elementals which exis\\nt at deep levels of the mind? Well, my \\nexperience is no, they are not. Some are pre - \\ncreated spirits, long d\\nead ghosts who seek \\nsome sort of revenge or those who have lost\\n their battles with C\\nhoronzon or as Lovecraft \\ncalled \"Azathoth\" (1) and drank too deeply from the \\nMother of Abominations. \\n Choronzon could be considered the same as\\n the Egyptian APEP, whom is a demon of \\nChaos. The Lord of the Luciferian Witchcraft Cultus is SET, the Prince of Darkness, is \\n\\nknown for his battle with Apep and by destroyi\\nng the demon, he becomes the master of \\nChaos. In the sorcerer™s life, he or she woul\\nd seek to become Set-like and master Chaos \\n(Apep). This is a point of High Sorcery and ma\\nstery of the earth. This is mirrored in the \\nLord of Air and Fire, Lucifer/\\nAzazel/Shaitan, revealed in th\\ne Holy Guardian Angel form \\nŒ Azal™ucel. \\n\\n \\nVampire Elementals are connected with deep\\n desires and lusts th\\nat emerge from the \\nsubconscious. If undiscovered they will often gr\\now with the desires of the individual until \\nthey rise to the surface. If individuals are unbalanced they create further dangers. I always \\nrecommend that the sorcerer be strong and \\nsound of mind before even attempting to \\ninvoke or evoke such elementals, for they ex\\nist on dark levels of the sleeping mind and \\nhold the keys to the gates of Da™ath. If one \\nis not prepared they will be brought forth to \\nthe gates and come face to face with Chor\\nonzon, madness will grow un\\ntil their reality is \\nnot his/her own. \\n \\nTo evoke elementals who are al\\nready in existence, yet based \\nin negative power zones is \\nperhaps just as dangerous because one is atte\\nmpting to control beings which exist outside \\n  19 19 their own time and space. They are defined as \\'demons\\' for this reason, being that nothing \\nis sacred and your life is alie\\nn to theirs. The other significant\\n point is that such spirits \\nseek your life force; they literally want to \"suck your blood\".  \\nSuch demons are powerful during ongoing astral\\n battles and defense;\\n however they are \\nnearly useless for positive workings.  Some \\nexceptions can be made however not many \\nare worth exploring. Use other means. I \\nwould recommend that the sorcerer begin \\ninvoking the vampire elementals within \\nthe mind before the ones beyond. One must \\nmaster the self before they seek to master \\ntheir universe! Being pr\\nimarily an independent \\nsorcerer, I rarely involve myself\\n in, or work with many other \\nmagickians within my rites. \\nOne particular example displays my reasoning \\nfor this: Several years ago, when we were \\nin fact diving \\'head first\\' into these theories, I had \\n\\na sigil constructed which was based on the Romanian Varcolaci vampires, an astral \\nwraith which took form flying towards the full moon on certain nights. \\n\\n \\nThe sigil involves an inverted\\n pentagram within the center, thus invoking a \\'sinister\\' \\nreaction from most people. The Pentagram is \\nnot by any means meant as either \\'Satanic\\' \\nor \\'Evil\\', however to merely invoke the esse\\nnce of inverse, or Choronzonic rites which \\ninvolve a semblance of the Death Posture in \\norder to reach the heart of it\\'s being. This \\nsigil is a representation of night side, shadow\\n or lunar forces. These forces are actively a \\npart of the individual \\nsubconscious and compose most of \\nthe matter of the brain. Fear not \\nthe powers of your mind, embrace the shadows! \\nI had two partners who seemed to hold a \\ngenuine interest in magick until they we\\nre faced with the ri\\ntes we had planned.  \\nThe sigil was painted and drawn on both a parchment and a back drop for the altar, giving an ominous direction for the rite, submerged in\\n the applications of astral vampirism. We \\nwere invoking the hidden vampiric aspect\\ns of the subconscious, given form by our \\ncollective will and focus. We sought to bring \\nforth a spirit fueled by blood, from which I \\ngave the offering of will. \\n \\nTowards the end of the invocations, one of the magickians became ill and had to exit the \\n\\nchamber, while the other persisted on with my\\n mantras. Before I had completed the other \\nhad decided this was not for him and remained \\nsilent, no further offering in the ritual. I \\nhad to close and banish extensively, for su\\nch forces remain powerful if not invoked \\nproperly and such disruptions we\\nre adding towards the demons \\ngrowth. I had fear that it \\nwas taking on the attributes of\\n our collected focus, a dem\\non of three heads no doubt!  I \\nhave since, learned from such an experience \\nto build barriers of banishing strength as \\nwell as working with only the well screened. \\nTo face Da™ath and control its elementals \\nand energies is to transpose the Abyss \\nand awaken towards a glorious morning! \\n \\nVampirism is a belief system of altered thinki\\nng and new focus. It is\\n not at all different \\nfrom the beliefs of any serious magus or sor\\ncerer who seeks to build\\n the black walls of \\nindividual strength. \\nThe subconscious holds ever key needed to awaken these primal \\natavisms: the serpent, the wolf, the dragon, \\nthe bat, the owl and \\nraven are all at our \\ncommand. The new age of shamanic tribal tran\\nsformation and atavistic resurgence is at \\nhand.   20 20  The vampiric path is not nece\\nssarily a life long dedicated focu\\ns, it is night side. In other \\nwords any other personal path of magickal \\npower and study such as Thelema (2), Chaos \\n(3), Voudon (4), etc. can be a primary focus \\nof the individual. The developed path of \\nvampiric sorcery is of the night and shadows,\\n when the sorcerer may shed his flesh and \\ntake to the night sky. \\n \\nIt is when the sorceress can assume the form \\nof the cat, raven or wolf and hunt for astral \\ncongress... all predatory instincts may be exercised and sharpened. There is no need for \\nthe vampiric sorcerer to stay away from the \\nsun or sleep in a coffi\\nn, they do not have to \\nwear black or paint their own \\nface white. It is based on the in\\ndividual\\'s will and desire not \\non show and gimmicks. \\n\\n \\nAll of the trappings and imagery of \\nvampirism is based on symbolism and \\ntransformation, for within the darkside one \\nmay become that black shadow depending on \\ntheir own desire. \\n Deprogramming and Will Training  \\nSuch is necessary for evolution and progressi\\non, as well as preparing for the vampiric \\ntransformation. In the alchemical change, fr\\nom basic programmed t\\nhought patterns to a \\nnew type of awakened indivi\\ndual, the process of deprogra\\nmming and training of will are \\nvery significant. It is \\ndangerous, as well as foolish, for th\\ne individual to go forth into this \\nregion of darkside magick without deprogram\\nming themselves. It entails the risk of \\nfurther burying atavisms, and making onese\\nlf vulnerable to vampiric possession. \\nElementals who are created and normally exis\\nt within the vampire current, will seek to \\nmanifest outside the dream sphere.\\' \\n\\n \\nBefore one can attempt to change their surroundings and work their magickal will, one \\n\\nmust master the self on each level. For th\\nis reason, a number of banishing rituals should \\nbe performed on several levels. This includes \\nGoetic (5) and Enochian banishing rituals, \\netc. This is only a basic start to the world of shadows. \\n\\n \\nTo begin to understand the basis of va\\nmpirism, one should study his/her own \\nsurroundings. This includes why he/she thinks\\n of certain things \\nthe way they do, how \\nhe/she treats friends, lovers and family, etc.\\n  If something offends you, why? This takes a \\nlarge amount of concentration but can be mo\\nst rewarding if one can go beyond the walls \\nof the conscious. A suggestion is to keep a dr\\neam journal, it is espe\\ncially significant in \\nthe beginning as you will be able to follow subsequent psychic developments and \\n\\nemergent thought patterns. Dream control stems \\nfrom the ability to \\nunderstand the self \\nand offer a power base within the subconsci\\nous. Foundations of iron are most important. \\nTo create something strong one must use th\\ne highest quality of \\nmaterials available. \\nEvolving a mental connection to \\nthe astral plane requires the \\nmost rigorous self-analysis. \\n \\nIt is during this period of analysis that\\n the aspirant becomes a \\'solitary\\', shunning \\nunnecessary contacts. The reason is that \\nthe mind and its magickal abilities are \\n  21 21 strengthened in solitude, and the methods of \\nwill training in isol\\nation are therefore the best companions. \\n\\nIt is during this time that the sorcerer is ab\\nle to further practice the methods of sorcery; \\nChaos, Thelemic and other methods of magi\\nck which will enable \\na strong transference into the astral world of vampiric sorcery. \\n\\n \\nThe individual will begin to learn and understa\\nnd that all things in this world can be \\nchanged or adjusted to the warlock™s will and th\\nat he/she is ultimately the master of their \\nown destiny. An aspect of proper training tec\\nhniques is that the aspi\\nrant takes to viewing \\nand studying things normally disgusting to their own personal taste. There are objective \\n\\nbut subtle reasons for this that will become cl\\nearer as they proceed. At the starting point, \\nit is of the utmost signifi\\ncance that the individual fo\\ncuses on understanding their own fears and pains, without these reasons necessari\\nly being clear. It will however be seen at \\nonce that this aspect of the training ma\\nkes for a devilishly strong individual.  Belief  Vampirism is the \\n\\nextension of the astral \\n\\nmind and night side \\n\\nreality. All that is \\n\\ntransformable from the \\n\\nflesh to dream is subject to \\n\\nchange on this level. One \\n\\nmust learn to separate \\n\\nhim/her self (which most \\n\\nstudents of the hidden arts \\n\\nhave done already) from \\n\\nthe sleeping world of \\npeople, lost in crowds, lost \\n\\nto themselves and \\n\\ndedicated only to \\nskimming by in their lives. \\n\\nThe successful magickian \\n\\nis one who realizes that the \\n\\nuniverse is composed of \\n\\nsimplistic beliefs which \\n\\nare only connected with \\n\\nthe extension of the mind. \\n\\nIf you believe it, and act \\n\\ntowards it then it is real. \\n\\n \\n \\nThe sorcerer realizes that \\n\\ngods are creations of man \\n\\nand that spirits and \\n  22 22 energies DO exist, though whether their exis\\ntence is in anthropomorphic form is \\nextremely doubtful. Gods are extensions of\\n the mind and it\\'s vast categorizing skills \\nwhich prove to have a significant role in alte\\nring and directing magickal energies towards \\nvarious goals, and in breeding our desires. \\n \\nThe sorcerer views life as sacred, and as it\\'s \\nkeeper, that it is thei\\nr choice which path to \\ntake in it. It is not \\nsurprising that most people choose \\na path of blind religion, believing \\ntruth is what a books states without explor\\ning for themselves. The vampire sorcerer \\nunderstands that everything must be questione\\nd and explored, for nothing is sacred and \\neverything can be changed. Life and joy is available to the fighting individual, one who is \\nable to go beyond what is dictated and forge a great path in his/her own life.  \\nThey also understand that no one else can \\naccomplish this for them, on the contrary, more \\noften than not other people and their belie\\nfs get in the way of achieving personal \\nhappiness. The vampire will realize that such\\n is the way of the world and it must be \\naltered from behind the scenes or mask of dreams if you will. The vampiric sorcerer is \\n\\nquite capable of going through life without an\\nother knowing of his magickal practice, \\nwhat he/she is capable of and that \\nall is subject to change via will. \\n \\nWhen I received the vampiric current in the early 1990\\'s I knew something was changing, \\nmy mind was opening: I knew that\\n ahead of me was either th\\ne great goal or total mental \\nruin. With will and courage, I allowed the current to manifest in my subconscious and \\n\\ngrow into a massive reality. This is true w\\nith other forms of magick, for each is related \\nand the goal is often the same. \\n\\n Magick and Belief \\n \\nVampiric sorcery is based on essentially the sa\\nme principles as more traditional forms of \\nMagick. The only exception is that darker \\nsymbols are sometimes involved. We do not \\nconsider these evil or harmful, as there is no \\nill intent towards anyone - they are simply a \\nmeans of strengthening and connecting with \\nthe self on all levels. Vampirism is quite \\nnatural to many aspects of the psyche with \\nwhich we desire connection. The Path of Evil \\nin an initiatory context is not in referen\\nce to moral or ethical \\npursuits or aberrations, \\nrather one of Adversarial Focus by such G\\nod forms of Antinomianian or Sethanic (Set) \\nassumption Œ separation from the natural order. \\n\\n \\nTo learn magick one must have begun to unde\\nrstand the self and indi\\nvidual strengths and \\nweaknesses. Magick is defined by Aleister \\nCrowley as \"The science and art of causing \\nchange to occur in conformity with will.\" (6) \\n\\n \\nThe process of belief is based \\non the already constructed real\\nity of each individual. Each \\nperson is a collection from different sources, \\nmixed together to form one \"group mind\". \\nThis is the picture that emerges when i\\nndividuals seek to embrace change while \\nstrengthening the self. In the dissolution of what seems to be an exterior and stable \\n\\npersonality we discover that change is \\nongoing, increasingly so as we follow a never-\\nending evolutionary process. Ritual involves\\n the restructuring of\\n previously defined \\n  23 23 desires and wishes. It is a fundamental reor\\nganization in relation to various points of \\nchaos; to reach beyond what is called the \\ndemon Choronzon, the guardian of Da\\'ath, to \\nthe astral region of wisdom and death, \\nresurgence and evolution. It is also the point and essence of ritual to enter into\\n the place of Neither- Neither (7) , the Abyssic \\nvoid of unconsciousness, wherein all is pos\\nsible and change can occur in actual \\nconformity with the individual\\'s ultimate desire. \\n\\n \\nIt is wise for the magickian to focus on holding a semi-stable mind, as serious magick has \\n\\na way of blowing up on you. The path of th\\ne magickian often pulls no punches and has \\nproven to be a difficult path. It should be th\\ne focus of the student to learn and progress \\nvia mind control techniques, breathing exerci\\nses, controlling all functions of the body in \\ndetailed measures. This requires that you \\nbe strong minded and focussed on what you \\nwish to accomplish.  By enteri\\nng the vast night side, in wh\\nich vampires truly exist, you \\nwill be opening yourself to a world whose \\nInhabitants may devour you unless strength \\nand the shield of WILL are present. \\n\\n Frozen Silence  \\nThe practice of holding the body in one position for extended amounts of time is very \\n\\nsignificant. The self in a ‚still™ or ‚frozen\\n™ state is often an avatar of building and \\ncontrolled energy. When an individual contro\\nls their thoughts on al\\nmost every level, \\nholding the point of consciousness between lines\\n of almost subconscious existence, then \\nthe mind is at the threshold of magick and \\nsorcery. This is why I have always relied on \\nphysical exercise and training \\nas a stepping stone towards magickal practice. The mind \\non the conscious levels works ex\\ntremely fast and remains intent\\n when one is engrossed in \\nphysical activities such as hiking, swi\\nmming, climbing, running, we\\night training and \\nsuch. A good time for sigil workings would \\nbe when one is focused on pushing the body \\ntowards a physical point of exhaustion. \\n \\nThe practice of freezing the body in one focuse\\nd state for an extended amount of time is \\nsuggested. Begin slowly until you are \\nable to sustain for over one hour. \\n \\nFind a comfortable and quiet area of your home. \\nArrange in the room a \\nsoft area to rest \\nupon. Begin to freeze every part of your body until it is as still as a corpse. This includes \\n\\nyour hands, eyes, mouth and facial expressi\\nons. You should not go to sleep or allow \\nyourself to enter ramblings of thought, but \\nfocus and concentrate on the stillness and silence around you. \\nTry to persist with\\n this method for a long period of tim\\ne, keeping a journal based on this \\nand other magickal training, studies and a\\nccomplishments. The magickal journal is a \\npowerful tool and record, presen\\nting insight into the great, va\\nst subconscious and a record of the world of dreams. Try to keep two j\\nournals, a dream book and a general magickal \\nrecord containing plans,exercises, accomplishmen\\nts, astral contacts, ri\\ntes, etc.  This will \\naid in your personal development and the tech\\nniques in which you employed as a part of \\nyour day to day system. It is \\nduring this time in which you \\npractice frozen silence that \\nyou will be able to lay a founda\\ntion for astral control, shap\\ne shifting, dream control and \\nfully exploring the functions of your human body. \\n  24 24  Yoga  Yoga is the process of contro\\nlling the body at all levels. This\\n requires a large amount of \\nmental and physical discipline which, when\\n developed, will \\nprovide a tremendous \\nreservoir of magickal ener\\ngy within the practitioner. \\n \\nTo develop the mind and spirit so that one ma\\ny work magick it is necessary to control all \\nparts of the body and brain. The gr\\neatest path of self control \\nis through Yoga. It is also \\nthe most difficult for the individual who is ne\\nw to this path. The magickian who seeks the \\nmastery of the self will no doubt be aligned with\\n Yoga and the levels of control it teaches. \\nThere is actually no way to study yoga, to \\nfully understand it one must practice and \\nemploy it for the advancement of the \\n\\nself. Yoga is very demanding for excitable \\nand energetic types, \\nbut with persistence \\nimplementing its techniques, contro\\nl can be developed quite quickly.  \\nThere are numerous levels to the different \\ntechniques and disciplines of Yoga, all of \\nwhich are equally significant in their bene\\nfits and developments of strength. Asana \\n(posture and control of body in frozen sile\\nnce); Pratyahara (cont\\nrol of the mind on \\ndetailed levels); Dharana, (control of thought\\ns, can be very disturbing as it makes you \\nmore conscious of the level of \\'noise\\' in the mind). \\n\\n \\nIt is during this that the magickal will is \\ntested, created and sadly more often, destroyed \\nbefore it is built again. I have had many associ\\nates quit the magickal path because of the \\nrigors of training, and the experiences involve\\nd. I am not surprised th\\nat people are broken \\nby the path, since the shadows, if not explored and understood, can overpower and \\n\\ndestroy the mind. \\n\\n \\n \\nDuring Dharana you will want to focus on a single thought for hours and take mental note \\nhow many times your mind ACTUALLY wanders\\n, this can prove to\\n be a difficult \\nexercise as you have to learn the necessity \\nof controlling the mi\\nnd on two levels- focus and understanding, vision and will. All of these can prove a frustrating experience. Do \\n\\nnot be deterred, a serious student will learn to overcome such an obstacle over time and \\n\\ntriumph. \\n\\n \\nControlled breathing is very im\\nportant as astral energy can be\\n transferred this way, also \\nmagickal will is often assisted by controlled breathing techniques. The student should \\n\\nspend several months learning to control hi\\ns/her breathing and posture. This will prove \\nbeneficial in daily life also, as disrup\\ntive events will be \\nless unbalancing, and the unruffled mind will be able to respond more effectively to unexpected occurrences. \\n\\n \\n Karezza    25 25 Karezza is a form of sexual magick, involvi\\nng building up and controlling sexual drive \\nfor transferring to magickal purposes. It is us\\ned to charge a particular wish, or focus \\nenergy and bring it into manifestation in a sp\\necific form. Karezza is an ancient technique \\nwhich requires an immense amount of control and concentration. It may include auto-\\n\\nerotic methods (masturbation) which are impl\\nemented to reach the point of orgasm and \\nshortly before the sorc\\nerer stops and focuses instead upon \\nthe symbol of their intention. \\nOnce this stage is complete the sorcerer can \\nenter a dream state in order to project the \\nideal envisioned. Karezza \\n\\nproduces exceptional results \\n\\nwhich can provide an \\n\\nimmense power base within \\n\\nthe self. The practice itself \\n\\nalso teaches discipline, \\n\\ncontrol and mental strength. \\n\\nThe essence of Karezza is \\n\\nthat once orgasm is denied \\n\\nthen this rampant energy \\n\\nwhich the sorcerer is \\n\\ncontrolling may, during \\n\\nvision or dream, be fulfilled \\n\\nin another desired area. This \\n\\nmethod can also be used to \\n\\ncontact a succubus or incubus \\n\\nand is a very useful technique \\n\\nfor purposes of evocation and \\n\\ninvocation.   Da™ath  \\nDa™ath is one of the zones of \\n\\nthe Qabalistic Tree of Life, a \\n\\ngreat void which is defined as \\n\\nthe Abyss. The Abyss or zone \\nof Da\\'ath is best understood \\n\\nas the dimension from which \\n\\nall begins or manifests, we \\n\\nare but spawn of the Abyss. \\n\\nThis is the Christian ‚hell™, \\n\\nevil only by the ignorance \\nand lack of understanding concerning the nature of Da™ath.  \\nThe world, nature and the universe as we know \\nit are indifferent to suffering, the same as \\nthe Abyss. All things manifest from this \\ndimension yet nothing remains within its favor, \\nall returns to it by the way of the grave at some\\n point. Life recycles itself. This can also \\nbe defined as what Spare termed ﬁthe Neither-N\\neitherﬂ. It should also be pointed out that \\n  26 26 ‚Neither-Neither™ is a inner dwelling concept of exploring the self, harnessing personal \\npower and consecrating sigils. ‚Neither-Neith\\ner™ is in many ways, a way of life. The \\nchannel towards \\n \\nTo attain this state one must reach a black\\n out point when the mind goes beyond the point \\nof conception, of when nothing matters and \\nall is unintelligible. This is when one \\nassumes the Death Posture, the flight of th\\ne self in ecstasy during which nothing exists, \\nyou literally ﬁstep outside yourselfﬂ. When the \\nindividual enters the Abyss there is no \\nconcept of the self, there is no form or matter in this state.  It is during this state that one \\n\\ncan inaugurate or enflesh the intense desires,\\n whatever they may \\nbe, during a state of forgetting the self. This is the direct\\n communication with the subconscious, the \\nﬁdelivering of the letterﬂ if you will. \\n\\n \\nThe sorcerer who dives through the Abyss and acts as an avatar for its power keeps the \\n\\nspirit bound to the earth, he or she escapes\\n the recycling for an amount of time. Many \\nmemories of a previous life ar\\ne lost in the traumatic act of\\n death; only the strong willed \\neven emerge with some essence of their power\\n source intact. It is often when the greatest \\nshocks and traumas are inflicted, when the exterior and ego built ‚selves™ are stripped \\n\\naway that the true power source, the core of \\nlife is revealed as it\\n really is. Aleister \\nCrowley often changed his image, assuming \\ndifferent appearances, guises and so on.  \\nThere is a reason and purpose for such actions, for how can one understand the various \\n\\navenues and different paths of life if one st\\nays trapped inside one \\nparticular ego? The \\nsorcerer who is able to\\n uphold the strength and character of\\n self through w\\nill is able to \\nmaster his or her own universe.  He or she can live as they will, creating or destroying as \\n\\nthey wish, and relishing all that makes life worth living. \\n This is why change is a wonderful thing, w\\nhy the dancing Egyptian God Besz is a chief \\nsymbol of the sorcerer, because the form is\\n constantly changing and evolving, each act a \\nreligious movement of life and joy. Even more \\nto the sorcerer™s benefit is that in modern \\nsociety change is an accepted part of life. \\nThis means we can move behind the scenes, do \\nour will and not be harassed fo\\nr our ‚different™ or ‚strange™ \\nbehavior, save the magickian \\nis not running about hurting others. \\n \\nDa™ath can be opened by the words ﬁZazas, Zazas, Natsatanada Zazasﬂ (words that are \\n\\nsaid to have been used by Cain and Adam to\\n open the gates of hell.) and explored through the Death Posture. The sorcerer who would en\\nter the Abyss must be pure of mind and in \\nharmony with his shadow or hidden self. \\n\\n \\nThe greatest obstacle of the Abyss is the demon Choronzon, whom the sorcerer must pass \\nin order to enter the Abyss. Choronzon is c\\nonsidered a demon due to it™s non - form and \\ndevouring nature. It is a vampire spirit, aw\\naiting the moment to enter the subconscious \\nand destroy it from the inside out. Once C\\nhoronzon has laid hold, \\nit keeps its hold until \\ndeath and beyond. \\n   27 27 Choronzon must be banished once it is passe\\nd through when great \\nvampiric rites are \\nconducted, such a demon should not be let li\\nnger, nor any communication be granted due \\nto the lying and false nature \\nof the essence. Choronzon seizes\\n upon every point of the self \\nwhich is confused, in conflict,\\n sick or twisted. It can take\\n and build upon any form of \\nhate, self-pity, depression and madness. This is\\n why the sorcerer who takes this path must \\nbe well disciplined and of a sound mind. \\n\\n  \\nThe significance of the rites of \\n\\nDa\\'ath is that having entered the \\n\\nreverse side of the \\nTree of Life, and \\npassed through the Da\\'athian gates, \\n\\na plethora of psychic and hidden \\n\\nknowledge becomes available. \\n\\nDa™ath is a conjunction and ‚child™ \\n\\nof the Qabalistic zones of Chokmah \\n\\n(Wisdom) and Binah \\n\\n(Understanding). As \\nIsrael Regardie \\npointed out in THE GOLDEN \\n\\nDAWN (Llewellyn 1971) : ﬁBut \\n\\nfundamentally it is the ascent of the \\n\\nDragon or, if you wish, an \\n\\nupwelling of the unconscious \\n\\narchetypes - a highl\\ny dangerous and \\nunbalancing ascent, \\nuntil they are \\nassimilated to consciousness - \\nwhich first renders Da™ath a \\npossibility. It is the fall which is \\n\\nresponsible for the acquisition of \\n\\nself-knowledge™™. \\n \\nﬁThus it stands provenﬂ claims \\n\\nBlavatsky ﬁThat Satan or the red \\n\\nfiery Dragon, the Lord of \\n\\nPhosphorus and Lucifer, or light \\n\\nbearer is in us; it is our mind - our \\n\\ntempter and redeemer, our \\n\\nintelligent liberator and savior from \\n\\npure animalism.ﬂ \\n\\n Da™ath is the zone where vampyre phantoms,\\n shades, ghosts and demonic spirits dwell. \\nThe necromancies of the night side of earth \\nare channels from whic\\nh the Qlipoth emerge. All morbid desires and acts which fester in \\nthe human mind are fed into Da™ath and the \\nQlipoth, for which exploration one must possess the highest mental and psychic strength.    28 28 Such spirits can be controlled, and are often servitors of the most willful sorcerer. Once \\ntheir purpose is fulfilled however, it is wise to banish or destroy them to save the ill \\n\\neffects afterwards. No Qlipothic spirit, \\nvampire or not, should be employed under any \\ncircumstance for matters of helping another, fo\\nr it is not of their nature. Such wraiths may \\nbe used as avatars of personal power but do not expect this to be an easy task.  \\nDa™athian spirits, if controlled and evoked pr\\noperly, are useful for cer\\ntain divinations and \\nvampiric explorations beyond the mind, as\\n subconscious guides and servitors for \\ndestruction, attack and defense, or in so\\nme species of sexual wo\\nrkings. Within such \\nsexual sorcery, such as Succubus/Incubus evoc\\nation, beware of the \\nobsessions that may \\noccur; they provide the most balanced yet the most dangerous approach to such work.  \\nDa™ath invokes change and subconscious\\n/shadow exploration. Through the use of \\nsentient symbols (see Chapter 4) one can co\\nmmunicate with the mighty atavisms of the \\ndark matter of the brain. By mastering and learning to control by will the essence of the \\n\\nself, one can be open to the vast Abyss beyond the mind. Take careful note that the Abyss \\nreflects the brain and its contents; one who dives the Abyss simultaneously with another \\nwill rarely see the same things. What is seen \\nwill reflect the realities and illusions of the \\nindividual mind. \\n \\nMany of the sorceries of the human lineage ar\\ne descended from the great Abyss known as \\nDa™ath, the stronghold of esoteric knowledge. Wh\\nen diving into Da™ath take a great astral \\nweapon, as strong as your will and as swif\\nt as your mind. Great afterlife survival \\ntechniques which have been discovered and \\nremain as possibilities were obtained from \\nthe flight through the mouth of\\n Choronzon, through the Abyss.  Qlipoth  \\nThe Qliphoth/Qlippoth is a Hebrew term for th\\ne region of the astral\\n plane where demons, \\nvampires, ghouls and other sinister spirits dw\\nell. Most of these beings, according to \\nKenneth Grant are \"habitations of the phant\\nom forms generated by sexual desires and \\nmorbid cravings constantly Produced by dwellers of earth.\" (8)  \\nWithin the realm of the Qlipoth, subsisting th\\nrough the plane of Da\\'ath, is the greatest \\ndepth of Night where the Great Red Dragon sleeps. Among the coils of the dragon are the \\n\\nshells of the dead, the spirits or lower dem\\nonic energies which flow between the dreams \\nof the serpent. These demonic forces must not\\n be trusted, however but controlled and sent forth to work your will. The vampiric so\\nrcerer will over time, gain enough psychic \\nstrength to open the Qliphoth an\\nd begin to transverse the curre\\nnt of this shadow astral \\nplane. This means also the Lion Trainer will\\n be sleeping with the Lions. Such Daemonic \\nforces should be dealt with car\\nefully in this aspect, for th\\ne formula is of the blackest \\nmagick.  From this region many vampiric elem\\nentals can be evoked to do the sorcerer\\'s \\nbidding, however the price is ge\\nnerally the gift of the sorc\\nerer\\'s own blood. The Qlipoth \\nare energy currents which \\nspring from Da™ath, which lies wi\\nthin the heart of the Desert of \\nSet (9). \\n   29 29 Tunnels which exist through Da™a\\nth are where most of the \\nQlipothic demons manifest. \\nPlease note that this is not a \\'Satanic\\' plane, \\nthese entities are negations of the self in its \\nprimal aspect.  Such spirits, whose existence is\\n not earth based but extra terrestrial, have \\nno conception of the meaning of \\'Satanic\\'. \\n\\n \\nExploring these tunnels opens wide the doors of\\n perception, as hinted in the theses of \\nmagick, and therein lie in wait devouring spirits \\nand demons. It is the \\ntask of the inspired \\nindividual to pass by these denizens of \\nthe deep, and by doing so discover the true \\nessence of their inmost self. \\n\\n INVOCATION-  \\nTo call spirits and energies/Godforms inward to\\n gain anthropomorphic \\nassociations or the \\ncommon and deeper attributes of the spirit. In \\nthe act of Invocation, the spirit is absorbed \\nby the ﬁIﬂ or self, in a Luciferian/Sethian se\\nnse, the sorcerer becomes or develops from \\nthe spirit called inward. Invocation is the \\ndirect subconscious communication with the \\nforces of ‚outer™ and ‚inner™ planes of bei\\nng. As with the Sabbat, both Infernal and \\nCelestial, one enters the ecstasy trance of\\n the inbetween (inbetween the dreaming and \\nwaking world) to emerge eventually as th\\ne Adversary, that Godform of both sides. \\n EVOCATION Œ  \\nTo summon or call spirits outwa\\nrd, often projected into a ci\\nrcle or area from which you \\nmay bind such forces or spirits to a specif\\nic area. In Goetic Sorcery, the individual \\nsummons or evokes a spirit or energy into a ci\\nrcle, when the sorcerer is satisfied; they \\nbanish/release the spirit so it may leave. E\\nvocation can be the sorcerer summoning or \\ncalling forth the darkest aspects of the self, i.e. atavisms, to Will them to manifest \\n\\nvisually or anthropomorphically \\noutside of the self. This is what Austin Spare called \\n‚Atavistic Resurgence.ﬂ \\n\\n \\n   30 30  SORCERY- The primal and illuminated act of focusi\\nng and controlling energy. The individual who \\npractices sorcery does so generally by means \\nof Will-Desire-Belief, to binding energy of \\nspirit into a focused and controlled object. Th\\ne term ‚encircling™ refers to sorcery. The \\nindividual who ‚encircles™ energy, shadow \\nor spirit is creating and willfully imposing \\nchange either internally (High Sorcery, Magick) or Externally (Goetic or Low Sorcery).  Blood and Sacrifice \\n \\nCoven Nachttoter/Coven Maleficia  finds that\\n if the magickian requires to offer a \\nsacrifice to a spirit, or in a magickal rite\\n, only the blood of the sorcerer him/her self \\nshould be used. Generally, if a sorcerer real\\nly desires the result or focus of the rite, \\ncutting themselves should be a welcomed act \\nof sacrifice towards the infinite possibility. \\nSpirits can manifest on various amounts \\nof blood and even though in Voudon animal \\nsacrifice is accepted, unless you plan to c\\nook and eat the animal as most Voudon \\npractitioners do, then it would not be advisa\\nble. The most signifi\\ncant sacrifice is from \\nyourself, as it is your offering which charge\\ns such during a rite. When evoking or \\n  31 31 invoking vampire spirits, the use of your bl\\nood (you being the sorcerer) will already create a binding effect on them in order to \\nactually containing or absorbing them. There \\nare those however who would use the harm of \\nothers to their benefit, which makes such \\nindividuals very dangerous and untrustwort\\nhy. They who would operate in such ways \\nhave no honor and should be avoided. \\n Sigils and Symbols  \"Sigils are monograms of thought, for the government of energy\" \\nﬁSigils are the art of believing, my invention for making belief organic, ergo, true belief.ﬂ \\n\\n- Austin Spare, The Book of Pleasure. \\n Sigils are the language of the subconscious. It \\nhas been mistakenly t\\nhought that sigils are \\nletter combinations in the style of Austin Spar\\ne. This is not correct by any means. Just as \\nmagick is personal to the individual, and \\neach sorcerer has his \\nor her own personal \\nsystem, so it is with the met\\nhods of sigil magick. One must \\napproach sigils as one would \\napproach art. To create a sigil one must ali\\ngn one™s natural talent \\nto their own brand of \\nsigil making. Sigils can be any \\nthing, a painting, music, drawi\\nng, letter symbols, pictures, \\nanything which is associated as a symbol in \\nwhich the original meaning could be lost and \\nforgotten, this is the key to success in such\\n work. The conscious mind must forget what \\nthe significance of the sigil is in order for the subconscious to absorb it and set it™s \\n\\nfleshing in motion. Never forget that sigils MUST be aligned with your natural ability, \\n\\nnot just a system devised by another. \\n\\n  The most significant sigil of Vampyric Sorcer\\ny and the vampire current is that of the \\nVarcolaci or Devilcosm Seal. The sigil, whic\\nh is composed of an inverted pentagram \\ncarried/connected by two varcolaci vampire spir\\nits. The inverted pentagram Œ also called \\nthe star of Set - represents the crossing into\\n the Abyss, for it is by mastering the upright \\nand inverse pentagram that the magickian tr\\nuly evolves. The union of the two Varcolaci \\nrepresents them as the doors of the gate of \\nthe Abyss, the entry to the astral plane of \\nknowledge as well as the Qliphoth, being the as\\ntral abode of vampires and other spirits. \\nThe bat like wings of the Varcolaci represent \\nthe powers of astral f\\nlight and the nightside \\ncurrent which exists through thei\\nr waves of sight. The pentagram itself is the symbol of \\nreverse entry via the Death Posture, in which \\ninitiation of the witch \\n is accomplished. The \\n  32 32 pentagram is the key to the Abyss and the \\nshadow spectrums of the mind. The Varcolaci \\nsigil was received via trance by Blood Moon As\\nuar (10), after a careful description from the author of what he received via the astral \\nplane. This was received and consecrated in \\n1994 e.v. and has been used in the vampiric current since.  \\nThe Devilcosm (another name for the Varcolaci \\nSigil) is as much a symbol for the Left \\nHand Path as it is a gateway towards the da\\nrk realms of night and fog. Through this \\nseeming mirror, you will be able to assume the wraith form so described in the \\n\\nDevilcosm sigil itself. Through these gates, \\nthe Queen of the Sabbath, Lilith gives you \\nthe knowledge to BECOME. \\n \\nThe rituals contained in this grimoire each \\ninvolve the use of the sigil. This feature \\nderives from Coven Nachttoter \\n(Coven Maleficia , a magickal \\nbase in which the author \\nreceived the setting to write\\n this book during the Babalo\\nn Working of December 1998 \\ne.v.) where this sigil was present in all ni\\nght side path worki\\nngs. Sigils permit an \\nindividual or collective to focus upon one strong\\n and consistent desire, by the medium of \\ngraphic symbol. Sigils are not\\n necessarily any one persons \\ncreation, however they should \\nbe complimentary to the individual\\'s own natu\\nral ability and interest. The personal nature \\nof sigil workings is present in the sorcery of\\n Austin Osman Spare. \\nSigils are \\nnot designed and implemented for the purpose of the sigil, \\nas many has done ignora\\nntly. Sigils are an \\nextension of an individual\\'s own personal pr\\neferences and talent. Both practical method \\nand actual intent depend inte\\nnsely on what is correct for th\\ne individual, wh\\nat feels right \\nand what they can achieve viable results with. \\nThis is a call to break down the near-there \\nattitude over which dogma presides, imposing \\nitself on all levels. Separation from such \\nlimits is necessary for the continuation of \\nreal personal progress on whatever level.  The Red Temple  \\nTiamat, considered as an aspect of Babalon (1\\n1) in the path of Vampirism, fits naturally \\nin the work of the Red Temple, meaning sex and blood magick. This can be highly useful \\n\\nwhen forming a new point of mental/magickal po\\nwer. Creation is very much a part of this path as well as the blood which is of dua\\nl meaning. Blood meaning astral and physical \\nmatter, the assumption being that blood can be \\nused in evocations of which spirits can \\nmanifest. \\n\\n \\nTiamat is also an aspect of Leviathan, the primordial angel of the deep, the crooked \\n\\nserpent that devours its own tail. As the Re\\nd Temple opens the Luciferian Gateway of \\ndeath and renewal of ones own Witchblood. \\n\\n \\nThe work of the Red Temple is of life and j\\noy, the sinister and the brilliant. Light and \\ndark. Sexual congress with a pa\\nrtner is a significant and fulf\\nilling aspect of this work. \\nThe awakened Kundalini or Fire Snake can\\n be channeled within both individuals \\nachieving a major focus and build up of energy. Strong bonds can be created through \\n\\nsuch work, although a dangerous focus of en\\nergy between the two leaves each vulnerable \\nto the other. A combination of the magick \\nof the Red and the Black Temple is a sexual \\ntantric work which involves \\nthe use of bones, ashes, bloo\\nd and sexual fluid (of both \\n  33 33 individuals given as a gift to a Loa or spirit\\n) towards the building of \"invisible walls\" or \\ncreating protective energies/elementals.  This \\naspect is explored th\\nrough sexual union, for \\neither the creation of a moonchild\\n or the calling of the dead. \\nThis ritual, which includes a \\nconsecration of a sigil covere\\nd in the blood and combined se\\nxual fluids should be given \\npower by a focus of energy. \\n \\nVampire spirits apart from incubi & succubi\\n should be mostly avoided in these rites \\nunless the spirit is absorbed or cha\\nnneled through your partner. Beware your \\ndevelopments, discipline is of the utmost impor\\ntance, lest the sorcerer become trapped or \\nobsessed by psychic vampires or demonic elem\\nentals. The difference between elementals \\n(not the same for Spirits who \\noften have will essence as we\\nll) and the sorcerer is the \\nWILL itself. Elementals have no will and ar\\ne collections of ener\\ngy. The individual must control and channel such patterns if he or she \\nis to be successful in the aspects of sorcery. \\n \\n The Black Temple  \\nThe Black Temple, being that of Necromancy \\nand the calling of the \\ndead is often quite \\nmisunderstood. This is by no means evil either\\n, in fact through tr\\naveling among the dead \\none is able to learn more about his/her self\\n and discover further hidden aspects of their \\nconnections with the gods of light and dark. It is important however that the sorcerer does \\nNOT become obsessed with the spirits which \\ntraffic in the work of the Red and Black \\nTemple, this will only lead to\\n insanity and mental pain. \\nCongregate with these beings \\nonly with will and discipline. Ne\\nver drink too deep from their \\ncups, especially if they are \\nelementals created by you. \\n\\n \\nSuch contact with the dead and other spirits can be done in a temple or ritual chamber. \\nOne should prepare by reaching \\na relaxing state of which you \\nseem to almost float from \\nyour own flesh. In this preparation incen\\nse should be employed, as well as music \\n(essential) which represents the mood of the r\\nite, and is appropriate to the forces evoked. \\nThis work may be done either solitary or \\nwith one other person, depending on your goal. \\nThen a calling should be made, an evocation following which you will begin (if \\n\\nsuccessful) to feel a slight bit \\nof wind and cold air. Do not \\nlet fear overtak\\ne you as I have \\nseen happen with many first time \"ghost hunt\\ners\", keep your wits about you and stay \\nstrong in this. Feel the spirits as the float about you.  \\nTechniques such as EVP (electronic voi\\nce phenomena) recording and automatic \\nwriting/drawing may be done as well which wi\\nll often produce significant results. With \\nexperience, after a time, it may be intere\\nsting to attempt to make contact with \\nextraterrestrial, non-human astral beings \\nwhich exist unborn (in human flesh). This \\nhowever, if the individual is not prepare\\nd, can prove dangerous and even mentally \\ndeadly. Be prepared for such a rite. Work \\nwithin the astral plane is also a strength \\nbuilding exercise, and is essential to mastery of magick. \\n \\n    34 34 Astral Projection and the \\nVisitation of the Dead -The Psychonaut-  You should adorn your chamber with vampiric\\n symbols and darkside objects which stir \\nyour imagination. The first step would be to\\n set a single red candle upon an altar. The \\naltar can have any significant symbols on it, \\nbut above the altar, framed if possible, \\nshould be displayed the Varcolaci Sigil. In\\ncense should be billowing in the chamber, \\nFrankincense, Jasmine, and \\n\\nRose are preferred. Each is a fragrance of our Coven and of Babalon, the Scarlet Woman. \\nIn my personal experience dream is a form of\\n astral projection. If I create a sigil for \\ndreaming and traveling/meeting with another,\\n then this can be done through an induced \\ntrance and then sleep. Many actually are able\\n to lie down and astrally project, while I \\nhave developed this ability, my own preference and greatest experiences are obtained \\n\\nfrom the dream/astral travel, from which all my\\n true desires become flesh. It is up to the \\nindividual to distinguish lucid dreams fr\\nom events involving the astral body. You will \\nfind perhaps - as I have - that when truly operating on the \\nastral/dream plane, when waking occurs, you \\nwill feel a wild jerk back into your body.  \\nOne should prepare for the dream by lighting \\nthe candle and focusing intensely upon the \\nVarcolaci sigil. As you are lying down, re\\nlaxed, feel yourself \\nbegin to enter the \\npentagram... feel the wind blow violently \\nin your mind as you ente\\nr... you feel naked and \\nalone. This is natural. A description follows ba\\nsed on one of my travel\\ns. Detail is kept by \\nactually recording the occurrence immediatel\\ny after waking. \"Once going through the sigil you will be in a dark plane with no obvi\\nous grass or ground. Trees are twisted and it \\nseems that at all times you are able to \\n\\nfloat above and below what \\ncould be ground. Upon looking clos\\nely at the trees Œ which \\nare twisted as writhing ghosts - you notice the roots which are extensive and elongated are held by nothing but air. They do not move, save for the spectral wind, which \\nwhistles through the skeletal  branches. \\n \\nIn the distance you hear moaning cries, or \\nchants which seem to be projected by a \\nhaunting collection of voices, e\\nach seeming so far away yet growing near you. There is \\nno light, save from a crescent moon which \\nis below you and not above. The sky is \\nreversed and the moon is blood red. Above \\nyou see nothing but sheer impenetrable \\ndarkness, nothingness... fear is\\n twisting it\\'s gray hand across \\nyour throat and you seek to \\ncontrol yourself. Will must preserve you. In \\nthe air you notice several spirals of what \\nappears to be white and gray funnel clouds, like a small tornado... this funnel cloud seems \\nto project a kind of screeching sound, which \\ndisappears again into the night. You feel \\nstrangely at home \\n\\nin this place, wondering if you have known it before. \\n \\nYou see a black tower in the distance, from \\nwhich the sound of wolves and female voices \\nchanting a mantra grows as you approach. \\nYou are floating yet at times walking on \\nsomething you are not quite awar\\ne of. When fear takes over \\nfor a fraction of a second you \\nfeel your walking slowed. Only\\n when will takes over can you \\nrelax and float. You make a \\nmental note not to let panic overtake you. The wolves howl in the distance, and a blood \\n  35 35 red moon, seemingly marked with a deaths\\n head, grows large below you. As you draw \\nnear the tower three black shapes approach \\nyou. You take note and with control of will \\nhalt in your steps. Your first impulse is \\nto run, however you know you would almost \\ncertainly lose your bodily contro\\nl, and movement would dimini\\nsh almost to the point of \\nstopping. Dreams always operate by the revers\\nal of laws which form the basis of your \\nreality web. \\n \\nOne of the shapes takes a seeming female fo\\nrm. You cannot tell many of her features \\nonly that she is molded fr\\nom the desires within your mind. Wolves come and surround \\nthe three shadows and yourself \\nin a large circle. The wolves\\n stare intensely, gray fur, \\nlarge salivating mouths with yellow fangs and burning crimson eyes... \\n\\n \\nThe female says nothing as she approaches \\nyou, neither do the two remaining faceless \\nshadows. You feel an envelopi\\nng chill as she draws near y\\nou. It is your assumption based \\non what could be deceptive body-language that she is welcoming you, yet warning you of \\n\\nwhat you have entered. You feel\\n no regret beyond the heart felt\\n fear which st\\nill clings to \\nyour very essence. \\n \\nThe Vampire sorceress reaches out with a \\nshadow like black arm. Instead of human \\nfingers they are black and le\\nather like, the skin stretc\\nhing thinly over bony, talon like \\nfingers. The ends have black \\nfive inch finger nails, like cl\\naws. You find this sexually \\nstimulating in some dark and twisted way, \\nonly wishing she would run them across your \\nnaked body, letting blood flow as a gift to \\nthe Red Dragon. Samael is closer. She takes \\nyour arm and slices a large wound in your arm.\\n.. she then draws the blood from the cut \\ninto her mouth... you hear an increase of mo\\naning and screams, mantras and howls from \\nthe lustful onlookers and from the tower. \\nThe lady drinks from you only briefly and then \\nwithdraws. She draws a razor shar\\np talon across her black chest, from which a stream of blood floats\\n from the wound towards your mouth. \\n \\nWith one talon she grips the back of your h\\nead and draws you into\\n the stream of blood, \\nall the way to the wound on her chest. You feel cold and yet so warm as you drink - the \\n\\nlust building within you as you feast from \\nthe wound of the vampire. As you feel lust \\ntaking close hold of you a viol\\nent jerk wakes you from your \\ntravel. You are back in your \\nchamber, sexually aroused and hungering for much more. Be patient, you have a lifetime \\n\\nof pleasure awaiting you - bot\\nh upon the astral plane and \\nthe physical one. Remember, \\ndiscipline is of highest importance in this path.\"  \\nMany desires, such as wanting to evoke a \\nsuccubus or incubus, as well as going to a certain location in dream can be done either with consistent concentration and/or the use of a sigil. The sigil would be drawn with several images and letters which represent \\nthe thought. You will arrange them in a way \\nin which the desire is unrecognizable and \\nthen consecrate the sigil by e\\nither orgasm or your own blood\\n. An excellent method is to \\nemploy the method of the Death Posture. Th\\ne Death Posture is a state in which you \\ninduce a form of unconsciousness stillness \\nthrough a difficult and painful standing or \\nsitting position. This is conti\\nnued until you collapse, all the while focusing and absorbing \\nthe sigil. Upon collapsing, you will regain\\n consciousness and de\\nstroy the sigil upon   36 36 obtaining orgasm if you so wish. The sigil \\nshould be burnt and tossed to the wind if \\npossible. For instance, if it was your desire \"To meet a \\nvampiric succubus in dreams\" you would draw\\n a sigil with various elements which \\nrepresent \\n\\nthat desire, such as a mantra of words like Ndeamn Smccvius, this would then be \\n\\nchanted over and over. You would first start slowly, pronouncing each syllable until you are completely comfortable with it and then\\n speed up the pace of repetition. The mantra \\nshould be spoken loudly and softly, total cont\\nrol over the sentence is what you are after. \\nThe mantra should be chanted throughout the si\\ngil rite, until you destroy the sigil that was \\ncreated with those words and symbols which \\nrepresent your desire. The conscious must \\nforget the sigil in order for the subconscious\\n to begin working towards it. This is the \\nprimary reason of destroying it. \\n\\n Ceremonial Magick and Vampirism  \\nCeremonial Magick was called ﬁT\\nhe rehearsal of realityﬂ by Austin Spare. This in my \\nopinion is not entirely the case. Ceremonial\\n Magick is the act of imposing your will upon \\nreality, by consciously aligning the Will with\\n the forces which he or she invokes. \\nCeremonial Magick is highly significant to th\\ne path of the magickian, as ritual focuses \\nand gives shape to the forces that the Warl\\nock is calling. The Cere\\nmonials within this \\nbook are composed on highly potent gnosis \\nmethods which can cause success or \\ncomplete ruin depending on the will of the sorcerer. In Ceremonial Magick the magickian \\n\\ngathers the forces of his choice within the Te\\nmple, which in Magick is the center of the \\nuniverse. As Peter Carroll mentioned in Liber Null, ﬁIn invocation, nothing exceeds like \\n\\nexcess.ﬂ so the Warlock must be fully engro\\nssed and concentrated upon the forces he or \\nshe is calling and the work at hand. Nothing el\\nse outside of the Temple is important, only \\nthe work at hand. The success factor within ma\\ngick comes when the sorcerer is able to \\nconvince the mind that the desired results w\\nill occur. The Temple can be a chamber or \\neven nature itself. Many witches will use th\\ne forest, since nature is their altar. \\n \\nThe temple is what you make of it. \\n\\n \\nBefore you would attempt to invol\\nve yourself in vampiric or \\ndarkside sorcery, seek to \\nmaster the foundations of Holy Magick, and ce\\nremonials aimed at contact with your Holy \\nGuardian Angel, or higher self. This is \\na strength building point which you can not pass \\nby. Ceremonial magick is present with\\nin vampirism only as a choice for group \\ngatherings. The purpose of Coven \\nMaleficia  and the current a\\nligned is not to hold group \\ngatherings and become a social event. Ho\\nwever when ceremonials are employed they are \\na focus and celebration of power, will and st\\nrength. The most significant ceremonial is \\n\"Towards the Vampiric G\\nodhead\" (12) which is a Mass of vampiric god forms and energy. Each\\n magickian will take the god form of a \\ncertain vampiric archetype which represents \\nsomething of his/her self. This can prove \\nmost interesting in the aspect of astral \\nblood. Ceremonials are also called upon for a great \\npurpose or astral blood \\nsacrifice. Each God form would sacrifice an \\namount of collected astral energy into what \\nis known as a Psychomantieon. A Psychomantieon or Necromantieon is a mirror that is \\n  37 37 used as the gateway towards the astral world.\\n It is also an object used in the Black \\nTemple workings as a gateway to the dead. Do you recall the legend of Lilith living in the \\n\\nmirror and the various vampiric tales \\nof beings communicating through mirrors? \\n \\nVampiric god forms exhale large amou\\nnts of astral blood towards this \\nPsychomantieon/Necromantieon until near e\\nxhaustion. This coincides with a sigil \\nrepresenting the groups desire\\n.  Upon the sacrifice the Magu\\ns would destroy the sigil in the flames of the ceremony. Each member at \\nsome point afterwards feels resurgence in \\nphysical strength and power. \\n Vampiric Strengths \\n \\nVampiric strengths closely resemble those \\nof the magickian who \\nfocuses upon the self  \\nand seeks to progress and evolve towards a \\nnew type of individual. Vampires, over a \\nperiod of time through study and practice, are \\nable to be more in tune with psychic \\nphenomena, such as communion with spirits, as\\ntral energy and other va\\nmpiric contact. It \\nis not unnatural for a learned vampire to sens\\ne the approach of anot\\nher awakened one - it \\nis all a case of the opening \\nof the mind. I do certainly reco\\nmmend a building of astral \\nwalls, of the \"Black Iron Walls\" (13) which w\\nill act as a protection from unwanted spirits \\nand enemies. Once erected, with Will, sweat an\\nd blood it is very difficult for another to \\ntrespass these walls. The vampiric strength \\nof astral shape shifting is through dream \\nmanipulation and awakening. The vampire who is \\nable to alter his/her form in the dream \\nis an awakened avatar of the great vampiric spiral force. \\n\\n \\nFor if opened one is able to take on the pe\\nrsonal and psychic attributes of the god form \\nthey most assume.  The wolf offers speed, the \\nbat offers flight, excellent night vision (in \\nbat assumed forms on the dream plane, from\\n personal experience an\\nd others testimony, \\nyou are usually able to see perf\\nectly compared to the bats\\' ow\\nn lack of eyesight.) and a \\nheightened predatory instinct involving the sm\\nell for blood and the speed of quick attack. \\nThe beast-wolf form is excellent for sexua\\nl congress and demonic awakenings, exploring the hidden aspects of the self on numerous \\nlevels. Smoke and mist are ideal for observing and surrounding or positioning near \\n\\ndesired \\nprey or enemy. Many other forms are possible, \\ndepending on the individual preference of \\nthe sorcerer. \\n\\n Dream Sorcery  \\nThe dangerous side of astral projection. The \\ndiscipline of dream magick is based on the \\naffinity of darkness and the spirit. The spirit\\n or astral double make take form and travel \\nthroughout the night and it™s worl\\nd (The Qlipoth, twisted dimensions, etc.). The dangers \\nof such journeying arise from th\\ne point at which the \\nindividual is seekin\\ng to let loose of \\nhis or her own flesh towards the web of \\ndreams. Nightmares often occur during this \\nundertaking, which may be only the beginnin\\ng of one™s pain on the mental level. \\nNightmares are the playground of Choronzon \\nand his minions, and only through the \\ndisciplined control of the psychona\\nut can one take from the night\\n side or dark force, feed \\n  38 38 the self upon it and \\nobtain strength and a \\ndauntless spirit. Dream Sorcery holds numerous \\npaths by which one is able to proceed. The as\\npect of predatory hunting or attack is one \\nsuch that may be undertaken. The key to master\\ny in all these paths is control and focus.  CHAPTER THREE Witchcraft and the Luciferian Path \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nWhat is Witch Blood? \\n\\nThere has been quite a lot mentioned in the area of witch blood and the like. What \\n\\nactually is witch blood and is such a hereditary title? \\n \\nWitch Blood can be described as the essence \\nof the gnosis, but a step beyond this mental \\naspect. Gnosis is defined as an extension of\\n magickal trance, from which the mind stops \\nall mental communication. Your mind become\\ns sharp and singled into one internal \\nconcept of action. This is called by Buddhists as\\n samadhi, the state of mental in-between \\nthinking which allows the subject to be united \\nwith the larger picture. Gnosis is the state \\nof magickal fountains of ener\\ngy, all of this exists in the inner core of your very being.    39 39 Witch Blood is a state of gnosis but so inte\\nrlocked with the subconscious that it stays \\nwith you throughout your life, a fine point of \\nliving which is enriched by not only Self-\\nLove but also unlocking the Nine Angles of Dream Mastery. Witch Blood is the mental state of what w\\nould be called genetic engineering. You seek \\nthe Luciferian Tradition, the dark of the mind and thus you open full your mind and allow \\nthe Pale Hecate to step in-you invite this \\narchetype.  By doing this alone you are standing \\nalone within the circle of \\nself-love and empowerment by your mind alone. Could this be \\nthe ‚short-map™ to immortality? Spiritual immo\\nrtality is not ignored within the writings, \\nbut within this grimoire a standard study and \\nroad map for the awakenings of Witchcraft \\nare presented and often hinted at. \\n \\nWitch Blood is the gateway to the magickal \\ncurrent within each individual. Witch Blood \\nis not an actual hereditary stream or geneti\\nc code, but a mental gateway and gift bestowed \\nby one who conceals the nature of the self a\\nnd self-love, the discipline needed to conquer \\nthe state of being. \\n \\nSome Christian based beliefs describe those \\nof the path of the Adversary, or Shaitan \\n(Lucifer) as demon-possessed. They state that \\nwe are conversing with demons and harbor \\nrelations with the devil. This is completely \\nTRUE! We are of the Adversary, the Devil, or \\nShaitan. Its voice speaks to us through our dr\\neams, through our very lives according to \\nour will. This IS Witch blood. \\n\\n \\nAnyone who has dedicated the se\\nlf to evolution and the path\\n of Sorcery may become one \\nof the Witch Blood, one who desires it so and is\\n willing to walk through the caverns of \\ndarkness to seek the light of\\n self! The Witch Blood is the aw\\nakened or obtained gnosis of \\ninspiration, that from which the subconsci\\nous mind is in tune with. All abilities \\ndeveloped with witchcraft are brought fo\\nrth through Sethanic knowledge obtained \\nthrough the receptive mind. Gnosis is Witch Blood except this state always remains \\n\\nwithin the subconscious; it is \\na light no one wants to go out!  \\nWitchcraft is the direct descendent of ancient shamanic cultures and practices, which has \\n\\nflourished with humanity since the beginning of \\ntime. The essence of witchcraft is of two \\nbasic aspects, being the discovery of the self and the unity wi\\nth nature, and the mastery of \\nsorcery and a balance of both dayside and \\ndarkside practices. The connection between \\nWitchcraft and the Zos Kia Cultus is more\\n profound than one may first believe. The \\nsorcery of Zos Kia Cultus has its roots in th\\ne Luciferian Tradition of which Austin Spare \\nwas heir by Witch Paterson. \\n\\nThe Sabbat of the Witches is also misunderst\\nood to some extent and there is a need to \\nfurther present theories and actual path wo\\nrkings which may open a new way of thinking \\nconcerning this subject. \\n \\nThe Witches\\' Sabbath is a gathering in dream\\n, not the physical gather\\ning that it once was \\nthought to be (Unless a conscious gathering is agreed upon as it is often done). The Witch \\nwho wishes to attend does so \\nprimarily in the astral or dream body. No babies were or are \\nharmed, no killing is done. The Sabbat is a gr\\neat appeal to the senses and a rejuvenation \\nof the spirit. Those who actua\\nlly attend the Sabbath are often refreshed, happy and more \\n  40 40 thoughtful of others. The Sabbath\\n is a celebration and channe\\nling of the powers of night \\nand the rejoicing of what one is and what one can be. \\nThe actual name SABBATH is derived from the \\nold French verb ‚s\\'esbattre™, translating \\n‚to frolic\\'. When twilight falls and the shadow\\ns become evident, all will transverse into a \\nside of night. \\nWhen our heads rest upon the ground our spirits\\n rise through the dream and the world of \\nthe night side. The Witch-cult exists in nume\\nrous points of the Earth, we walk silently \\namong all and harm not one unless provoked. \\nWe are shadow and the essence of the \\ngreen earth is our being. \\nThe witch blood emanates deep within the \\nsubconscious of each so\\nrcerer, awaiting the \\nmoment the wizard opens the lunar current \\ntowards Atavistic resurgence (2). The \\nVampire spirit too exists in dream and so wi\\nth it we shall walk, \\nin joyous brotherhood \\nand sisterhood. \\nThe eight earthly Sabbaths\\' are as a form and focus for the dreaming rite, in which those \\n\\nof witch blood meet in ecstasy. \\n\\n \\nThe earthly Sabbat is as a gate and purificati\\non zone whose purpose is \\nto create the astral \\ngrounds in which the meeting is to take place. The following rites may be conducted with \\n\\nvery few people, be it two or ten indivi\\nduals, fulfilling each members dedication and \\ndesire. \\nThe Sabbat of the Witches exists in the cont\\next of dream control \\nand breaking over into the astral world, where all is based on desire and will. The manifesting of day side \\n\\nactivities are brought forth th\\nrough the dreaming - darkside - aspects of sorcery and \\nmagick. \\n\\nA particularly memorable event when I attende\\nd an astral Sabbat and became fully aware \\nof the current in its witch-blood origin. In \\nsuch a situation, you feel as though the dead \\nare speaking to you... di\\nrecting you towards the Luciferian Mysteries.  I was self-\\ninitiated, being a natural loner and finding \\nmy greatest access of the current was when \\nalone or with one other individual, enabled to focus and receive the \\nspark of inspiration. \\n \\nI had prepared well for the night, shaping \\na wonderful mood that\\n was befitting such \\ndreaming. An ointment was prepared and a small amount smeared in the form of a sigil \\n\\nrepresenting the astral conc\\nlave. I was robed in black, af\\nter a relaxing bath. Candles \\nilluminated the house and the sole company of \\nmy cat gave me yet further inspiration. \\nThe woven web of night is one that can gu\\nide your every movement\\n, to every urge the \\nweb will respond. The Spider and \\nSerpent that exist in the ni\\nght side are of symbolic \\nnature, being of reversion and double senses, of speed and accuracy.  \\nI focused upon my star, the inverted pent\\nagram, meaning ‚Life and Mind™ and made \\nproclamations to the Lord of the Sabbath, be\\ning the Adversary or the shadow form of \\nLucifer. \\n \\nCandle lit, burning black in the darkness of the chamber I whispered before the flame: \\n \\nﬁBy the embrace of death™s sleep in life, Thanat\\nos hearken my swift flight. Of the Devil™s \\nsight, which views the webs of night to co\\nme and the freedom of the fields, may thy \\n  41 41 beauty be as my gift. By the thorns whic\\nh tear the waking flesh and guards our great \\nhidden place, be my flesh in night and astral\\n waking, I shall emerge. I seek the Blood of \\nthe Witches Sabbat conclave, so that Lilith\\n shall kiss my ever earthly wounds. Joy and \\npleasure, by the Skull and Blade I shall emerge! \\n\\nEko Sabbatium, Eko Hecate,  Eko Lilith–unbound and fly!ﬂ \\n\\n \\nMy pace was decided by my desire to join th\\ne conclave, to enter th\\nis Sabbath of dream. I \\nwas guided into a great forest, and my flight\\n was over the trees. I was drawn to a seeming \\ncrossroad deep within the forest, clear of trees and filled with shapes and hags. They had \\n\\nassembled to fulfill the desires of the flesh a\\nnd to further inspire the witch blood within \\nour astral veins. A great fire, spinning and sp\\nitting shapes and faces, grew in fever. This \\nseemed to act as a gate towards the great r\\nites and Loa of the Petro (3) tradition. Women \\nwho danced around the fire would consistently\\n shift their shapes becoming alternately \\nhags or beautiful young women, or forms be\\ntween both. Many would take the form of \\nanimals, howling or flying around this great \\nastral Sabbath. Many of the shapes were \\ntaking pleasure in each other,\\n the dancing of demonic shap\\nes and the chanting of unseen \\nvoices through me into an explosive frenzy. I could feel the beast come to the surface, \\n\\nfully aware of predatory instincts and emo\\ntions not normally explored on a conscious \\nlevel. \\nBeyond the fire stood what I termed the \\'Black \\nOne\\', the Goat headed figure, the living \\nsigil of desire. Flames burned from its blac\\nk and green claw like hands, fire of blue and \\nred. My attention re\\nturned to the ecstasy \\nof the congregation. I s\\nuddenly began to fade \\nand everything beyond this was \\nblank. I awoke the next morn\\ning, feeling refreshed and a new sense of happiness flowed throughout my\\n being. It must be \\nunderstood that this \\nrising in astral or dream flesh \\nmay not be an easy task for all,\\n some have a natural affinity \\ntowards this while others must train and e\\nxpand the mind through will. The essence of the \\nwitch is of Hecate, or the m\\noon. The joy and love for the night and the great, vast powers \\nof the mind. The training of the Sorcerer is \\na lonely and difficult pa\\nth, a great reward for \\nthose who can remain. \\n\\n The Witches Pyramid \\nOath of the Sorcerer \\n The greatest teacher of magick is experience \\nitself. No book can give great secrets of \\nsorcery, only the inspiration to actively expl\\nore the great winding pa\\nth of sorcery. The \\noath of a sorcerer is known commonly as the Witches\\' Pyramid. This is an oath primarily \\n\\nto the self, to reconfirm honor and high regard\\n for the self. Actions which alter the belief \\nsystems of individuals, known as Paradigm shif\\nts are nothing more than (in most cases) a \\ncheap and easy way out of a situation, to avoid responsibility. If one generally relies upon their own wits and mental st\\nrength a paradigm shift is ha\\nrdly necessary and should be \\ntaken only in the most desperate situations. \\nTough situations will reve\\nal the true nature \\nand strengths, weaknesses and faults of th\\ne individual and thus should not always be \\navoided.      42 42 To Know \\n Knowledge is key and central \\nto belief systems and advan\\nced techniques of magick. \\nWords tend to define a common or resurgent \\npattern of thought and action. Many of the \\ntechniques we have worked with whether of\\n the Sethian Witchcraft, the Zos Kia Cultus \\nor Vampiric Sorcery are based upon images rath\\ner than mere words, However I sought to \\nlay them out in a context whic\\nh can be discernible. Once knowledge is obtained it is up to the individual as to whether it should be freely given. Knowledge of the self is fundamental to your \\nability to practice this art of the hidden. The \\nstatement  \"Know Thyself\" is significant in th\\nat therein lies the ke\\ny to personal power. It \\nhas been said this is not accurate since the se\\nlf is ever changing. The key essence of this \\nstatement is that even though the exterior an\\nd first layer of the interior is always \\nchanging, the basis of the individual, \\nlearned through childhood and teenage years remains within the ever changing persona. Only\\n those who have extreme imbalances such \\nas personality disorders (ie multiple personalities) are unable to control significant \\n\\nchange. The sorcerer is an avatar of th\\ne magickal current which is embodied through \\nhim/her. The significant and essential \\'trick\\' is to realize that the magickian is the \\n\\nmanifestation of that particular current of \\nenergy. The traditions of which I speak are \\naligned and/or parallel with the 93 current, known as Thelema which is Greek for Will. \\nThe witches™ oath ‚to know™ is a symbol of retention of knowledge gained in life.  To Will  The Will of the sorcerer is the strength of magick and witchcraft, to change his/her \\n\\nsurroundings according to the desire held. Without the Will magick is not and holds no \\n\\npower. Focus and belief issue forth an inde\\npendent view and st\\nrength which none can \\ntouch. The Astral Sabbat for instance is unobt\\nainable for those without the desire to \\njourney to it, to become with the spirits of \\nthe dead. The Will is the direction and internal \\nfocus which guides him/her through their life. The True Will or ‚Knowledge and \\n\\nConversation of the Holy Guar\\ndian Angel™ implies knowing \\nthe essence of thyself and \\nthe direction it should lead one in life. \\n To Dare  To dare is to test the methods \\nof sorcery, to push \\nthe self to the limits\\n both mentally and \\nphysically. This is the essen\\nce of knowledge and the buildi\\nng of individual strength. To \\npursue that which could invoke a hidden mechan\\nism within the brain to further advance \\nthe individual power is always implied. That\\n which inspires you is the fountainhead of \\nthe Gods, to dare the methods of belief and ch\\nange as the spirit gui\\ndes you. To go beyond \\nall physical limits and mental obstacles is to\\n instinctively pass beyond and face any thing \\nwhich would further develop and strengthen the self. Fear pushes the true individual, the \\nvery pulp of it all to the surface and therefor\\ne can be most useful in discovering the \\nhidden obstacles which could hinder you in a dire situation.      43 43 To Keep Silent  Secrecy is the honor of the Sorcerer, the ve\\nry essence of the genetic make up which \\ndefines who a person is. To taste of the ecsta\\nsy of Lilith and Hecate, to know of their \\nessence and to utilize it demands the respons\\nibility of the indivi\\ndual who undertakes the \\npath. The oath of the sorcerer is everything th\\nat he/she is, to which they would ultimately \\nanswer to.  Kia is everything that is and th\\nat takes form. Shape it as you will with caution. \\nWhat is considered individual honor defines the methods that each person should and will \\ndevelop over the passing of time. This grand \\noath of the Magickian should not be taken \\nlightly, but is the foundation fo\\nr the type of individual who \\nshould be successful upon the \\ngray path of Wizardry and pow\\ner! Undertake the oath not fo\\nr any group but for yourself \\nalone. If you decide to join \\na significant group for further ceremonial training then you \\nwill already be ahead in technique\\n by the development of character. \\n   The Sigil of the Witch Moon Œ The Calling Point of Hecate \\n  44 44  (The sigil of the Witch Moon is a communicat\\nion point of Hecate and Black Isis (4) . ) \\n \\n Initiation Purpose and Symbolism \\n  The dedication towards the magickal path is a \\nfar from simple task. Static symbolism and \\nthe concocted trappings of ma\\ngick are often no more than dogmatic sickness which can \\nlead to stagnant development. \\nIt is therefore suggested that \\nthe sorcerer is one able to \\nchange their self and immediate surroundings as \\nthey see fit. Beliefs change with will and \\ndesire, to suit the development of the indivi\\nduals™ personality. I have known quite a few \\ngifted individuals, magickians and otherwis\\ne, who in the beginning present an immense \\namount of potential. Many have fallen away in\\nto stagnant slumps of failure due to the \\nfact they never rise and deve\\nlop as their beliefs change. I urge each one to progress in \\ntheir own time, while always keeping their in\\ntegrity and individualistic strength. Imposed \\nmoral codes are nothing but shackles for t\\nhose without personal honor. An individual \\nwho has a strong personal morality is able to break with moral dogma in order to find his \\n\\nor her true essence of self.  Once one has \\ndeveloped their own personal convictions and \\ndeveloped a sense of honor it should be adhe\\nred to, save for a paradigm shift which \\nwould render the sorcerer useless for true ma\\ngick, being that of \\ngrowth and progression. \\nSpirits will seek to destroy an individual w\\nith no honor. Unable to keep his or her word, \\nthey fall prey to that which lurks fore\\nver in the shadows of the subconscious.  The initiation into the Luciferian Witchcraft is based on pushing the self, tearing away all \\nmasks which make up the outside of the indivi\\ndual until the basic essence remains. This \\nis the way in which one begins building so\\nmething strong and honorable. The essence of \\nthe initiation is to dedicate \\nthe sorcerer to the life long pa\\nth of magick, wherein a great \\nand beautiful flower awaits those of awaken\\ned and enlightened paths, the making of a \\ngod or goddess. The self is god and goddess, si\\nnce you ultimately answer to yourself. \\nMake your self happy before attempting to do so with others. Sabbat symbolism refers to \\n\\nthe serpent that sheds his skin, enabling the \\nrise to the stars of midnight and dawn, and \\nentry to haunting mist and subterranean cav\\nern. I stress the issu\\ne of Sorcery being \\nextremely personal to the individual who pr\\nactices it. One who approaches magick as \\nimpersonal will obviously be a failure since successful sorcery demands a strong and \\n\\nfocused conviction and frame of mind. One \\nmust understand that in order to create \\nchange, significant knowledge and superior pres\\nence must exist to reach the desired goal. \\nInitiation into the Sethanic Mysteries is ba\\nsed on a loose but well pr\\nacticed doctrine. The \\nwitch requires an area of land, preferably w\\nooded, in which solitude is possible.  The \\nmentor or partner can be present to give \\ndirection and guidance. The witch has a small \\nbonfire going and is draped in traditional ga\\nrments, hooded robes of white, appropriate to \\nthe initiation process. Any othe\\nr objects such as pentacles, \\nsigils and other talismans can \\nbe worn as well, depending on the individuals\\n interest and alignment. The color white \\nrepresents purity, and humility or novice status. It is thus suited to those who have not \\n  45 45 tasted the mysteries of light and dark. Thus \\nit precedes the gray of the magickal current \\nthat flows towards the toad™s moon, \\nto which the night pays homage. \\n \\nA dagger should be present, not an Athame \\nper se but a virgin dagger with which you \\ncould easily cut yourself. Once the banishing ri\\nte is complete, focus on your environment \\nand all of the beautiful and \\npleasant things around you, the \\nforest, the wind, the animals \\nand the great darkness that approaches, the \\nnight in its full and magnificent splendor - the \\ngreat predators of nigh\\nt that fly about the shadowed skie\\ns. You are now in\\n the bosom of \\nthe great goddess, she of many names to whom \\nall forms of life even\\ntually answer. Face \\nthis with great understanding of who you are an\\nd remember that, other than a vehicle for \\nthe magickal current, you are nothing. All living things, great and small come and return \\n\\nto dust, the great womb is \\na spawning ground of genetic isol\\nation and personality. Time \\nis not our own yet it is within our control.  \\nKnowing this, you are truly free to do what\\n you will and live your \\nlife according to your \\ninner desire, independent of external manipul\\nation. The purpose of in\\nitiation is to set you \\nupon the path so that the self may be reveal\\ned. The Holy Guardian Angel or True Will \\nshall manifest in time and with practice.\\n While you a wait that moment however, push \\nforward and be one with the Path! \\n \\nThe circle should be cast outdoo\\nrs if possible with a circle\\n of flour, observe the four \\nwatchtowers and focus upon all elements flowin\\ng fire, water, air and \\nearth. The angelick \\nspirits of the aethyr which \\nguard the foundations \\nof human development shall observe \\nwith your calling. They are th\\ne Watchers often revealed as demons. Know their nature \\nwell. \\n A witch would now perform a dedica\\ntion chant, an example would be: \\n \"By the rights of pleasure may \\nflesh procreate from within. \\nMother of the Sabbath, Lilith I awaken to the mysteries of our \\n\\ncraft. I dedicate my being to \\nthe path from which my blood \\ndictates. By the mysteries of the Goat and the Serpent I come to \\n\\nthee. I walk now the Luciferian \\nPath, reborn under the Luciferic Shadows and Promethean Light! \\n\\nShaitan Œ Asmodeus Œ Belial Œ Lilith Œ Hecate Eko, Eko!\" \\n \\nThe witch would now make a cut \\nand draw blood, letting it dr\\nop into the soil. This would \\nbe followed by the vision of a brilliant white \\nlight which is followed by the ascent of the \\nMorning Star, Lucifer. This symbolism is \\nbased on the essence of Lucifer in the pre-\\nChristian Gnostic status of  \\nBringer of Light. The Gnostic \\nmethod of overcoming the self, \\nbecoming all and none. The ini\\ntiate should then disrobe and \\nbegin traveling through the \\nforest, running, jumping until complete exhaustio\\nn overtakes their very being. This would be a very close and early representation of wh\\nat is the Death Postur\\ne, which the initiate \\nwould undertake some time later.  This is \\nthe manifestation of what is known as the \\nGreen Man in witch cult tradition, an incarna\\ntion of nature and wisdom, perseverance and \\nsilent wisdom. It is almost \\nalways the most silent who \\nholds the most personal power. \\n  46 46  The Sabbat exists in the Highest aspects \\nof the mind (Luciferian) and the darkest \\n(Infernal), for instance a working for vigor, \\nlight and astral initiation one would seek the \\nLuciferian Sabbat. Any sexual relations in \\nthe Luciferian Sabbat would be a union with \\nanother in a desired aspect of self Œ deve\\nlopment. One who seeks to transform into a \\nbeast, wolf, bat or daemonic form to seek se\\nxual congress with the as\\ntral dead, ghosts or \\ndemons of the mind or beyond would seek the In\\nfernal Sabbat. The Infernal Sabbat is the \\ndegree of solitary initiation via \\ndream. The Luciferian Sabbat is a higher initiation of the \\nisolated self; very much like Azaze\\nl, who is revealed as Lucifer. \\n \\nIt was an early Latin writing scribed in\\n 1460 on Arras witches presents a possible \\ndreaming image of the Infernal Sabbat Œ \\n\\n ﬁAt the sabbats of the Vaudois, th\\ne presiding devil took aside the neophyte and carried her off to one \\nside of the grove, so that in \\nhis own fashion he might make love to her and have carnal \\n\\nknowledge of her; to whom he said\\n maliciously that he would lay \\nher down on the ground supporting herself on her two hands and \\nfeet, and that he could not have \\nintercourse with her in any other \\nposition: and that was the way the presiding devil enjoyed her, \\n\\nbecause at the first sensation by the neophyte of the member of \\n\\nthe presiding devil, very often it \\nappeared cold and soft, as very \\nfrequently the whole body. At first he\\n put it in the natural orifice \\nand ejaculated the spoiled yellowing sperm, collected from \\n\\nnocturnal emissions or elsewhere, \\nthen in the anus, and in this \\nmanner inordinately abused her–.ﬂ \\n The text explains the possibilities of the experiences of the Dreaming Infernal Sabbat, to \\n\\nbe undertaken by Will of the Sorcerer or Witc\\nh. This ecstasy may be explored and used \\nto strengthen the initiation of the individua\\nl, and to allow communion with ones familiars \\nand servitors. \\n   47 47  OSCULUM INFAME AND THE SIGILIUM DIABLOI \\n The ‚Kiss or Shame™ or Devil™s Kiss has repr\\nesented since the medieval times the kissing \\nof the devil™s behind, or end quarters as a de\\ndication to the Left \\nHand Path. The context of defining this ritual dedication was propa\\ngated by the Church and was a charge often \\nthrown at those accused of witchcraft during these times. \\n\\n \\nWhile the essence of the Dark Sethanic Witchcraft is based on the principles of reversion \\n\\nand descending to achieve and awakening, the \\ndevils hind quarters are not evoked to be \\nkissed. This is however, a powerful point of \\ninitiative symbolism representing the darker \\naspects of Witchcraft. \\n\\n \\nThe most significant point before beginning a life\\n travel down the Luciferian Path is to \\nunderstand the symbolism which represents know\\nledge and wisdom. The Devils Mark is \\nbut a glyph of what is consid\\nered awakening or the emergen\\nce of the primal atavism, and \\nits opposite being the serpent.\\n The serpent, as represen\\nted throughout history means wisdom and awakening, while to Christ\\nians is normally a symbol of evil. \\n \\nThe Osculum Infame should be practiced as eith\\ner solitary or within\\n the Coven you are to join. It is essential and imp\\nerative that one is also know\\nledgeable and strong enough to \\nchoose his or her coven in a bus\\niness like, inte\\nlligent manner. Do not \\njoin simply because \\nit is the only one in your area, or because \\nyou like one of the members. Please in all \\nmanners and means focus on the core of the \\nCoven, what the skelet\\non represents. Many simply seek fleshly pleasures yet have no c\\noncept or grasp on thei\\nr responsibility. That   48 48 responsibility is to seek to perf\\nect the self in all ways. It is \\nalso essential to enjoy yourself \\nand to harness your skills at both Black Magic and Holy Magick.  \\nThe history of the dedication was perpetra\\nted by medieval witch hunters who in base \\nwere impotent bigots, who could not understa\\nnd nor accept the equality of women within \\na cultural context. The Kiss was assumed into \\na feminine submission because that to take \\nup with the Devil, one should intimately know \\nthis spirit. The males, or heterosexual \\nmales would in turn have congress with female\\n succubi, or children of Lilith. The legends \\nof Nocturnal emissions carried on with thes\\ne initiations or dream-induced congress. \\n       49 49 Osculum Infame \\nThe initiate™s dedication \\n To undertake the initiate™s oath of Witches,\\n by the symbolic kiss of shame. The pact \\nshould take place out in the open air, a wooded \\narea with your altar being a stump or rock \\nnear a large tree. Decorate the altar \\nwith the wood carving of the Witches \\nSabbat/Luciferian Inverse Pentagram, or Sigil of\\n Lucifer. Within the context of this tome, \\nLucifer represents knowledge, wisdom and li\\nght. Baphomet, the God of Witches may be \\nadorned on altar as well. Octinimos, of the Witches Sabbat Goat is symbolic of masculine \\n\\nand feminine pro-creation and knowledge. \\n\\n \\nThe fire of Hecate and Lilith should be burne\\nd, robed or nude-the dedication towards the \\nforces of night and of the Witches Sabba\\nt way. The dagger should be your Magickal \\nweapon of Air and Fire. \\n \\nThe Lord™s Prayer Backwards is utilized from\\n Witches Sabbat lore to separate and release \\nthe subconscious from the society bounds of \\nwestern dogmatic or restrictive religions. \\nWhile the rite is sinister, to proclaim indepe\\nndence from ones restrictive conscious, this \\nhas been cultivated from birth by our cultures\\n. This is not a Satanic rite but one of \\nLuciferian provenance, the awakening from th\\ne sleepwalkers. This is to be noted, the \\ninfant shaky steps of what will come after \\nthis. Throw your soul in\\nto the workings! Keep \\nin mind that Sathan/Satan is but the MIND, and is a great well of inspiration and \\n\\nknowledge to those that may summon this force. \\n \\nYou should conduct this working on a full moon \\nnight, or at Noon when the Sun is high.  \\nThe inverted pentagram will be used in this \\nrite; a traditional pent\\nacle upon the altar will do well. You will also need your anthame. Th\\ne mirror in front of the altar should be \\nilluminated with black candlelight. The circle\\n should be cast before the altar with the \\nbillowing smoke of incense. \\n\\n \\nYou will also want a quill and parchment paper,\\n to scribe in black \\nink the oath which you \\nshall sign in the blood of your left hand. \\nThe parchment should be written in something as the description given: \\n I,___Birth name\\n___, hereby on the day of _________, announce \\nthe dedication to the path of the \\nwise, from which \\nthe Left Hand \\nPath shall be revealed unto me! \\nI proclaim my birth rite towards \\nthe Luciferian Path of ascension. \\nI free my spirit to be now free unt\\no myself, so that I may develop \\nthe gift of Azal™ucel, the Black Flame itself! \\n\\nMy name shall now be ________________, a child of the Fallen \\n\\nSeraph, Asmodeus, Astaroth, Belial and Lilith bless my sacred \\npath to the great serpent-a\\nngel Shaitan called Azal™ucel    50 50 I now cut myself in the name of the dark bringer, Noctifer, the \\nDevil by Twilight. That eye sight grows in the weavings of dusk \\n\\nand dawn. The Gates of the Dead are opened! \\n \\nBless my mark, which is the Si\\ngillium Diaboli, the new Flesh \\nemerges! \\n\\n \\nSo it shall be! \\n \\nWitch Name in Blood cut from left hand\\n  \\nVibrate in a hissing tone, until it fo\\nrms as an unrecognizable mantra: \\n Zazas, zazas, nasatanada zazas! \\n\\n Face now the altar, holding the dagger: widd\\nershins around the circle and recite the \\ninitiation words: \\n Nema, live morf reviled tub!

Asmodeus \\nis a God of sorcery a\\nnd dark or nightside \\nearth based magick, as is Belial within these \\narts. One will affirm \\nboth spirits as well as \\nLilith. \\n \\nThe first will be the Yezdic peacock angel, Shaitan/Melek Taus. Let its form be under \\n\\nAsmodeus, the son/husband of Lilith (as Samael in some Hebrew lore). \\n\\n By the oath of Belial and Satur\\nn, the awakening of hidden light The lifting of flesh through dream and chant \\n\\nI call upon thee, Asmodeus, devil lord\\n of the winds of forests and \\ncaves \\n \\nSpeak upon the web of dreams, \\n\\nI invoke thee within my very essence, by serpent and wolf \\n\\nBy fire and earth, ice and snow, desert and heat Pass beyond the veil little known by most, \\nFor I am a child of this flesh! \\n\\n \\nI offer now my dedication of my \\nown Will to the powers of night, \\nand of the Great Work itself!

I shall know of this by \\naction and experience! Osculum In\\nfame, the diving of the great \\ndark pit! \\n \\n \\nSo it is done!  \\nBanish and Close circle. \\n Do not destroy the oath of initiation; this wi\\nll be placed in a special box with most of \\nyour first-born workings. Bless the box under \\nvarious Goetic spirits and keep hidden and \\nsafe. \\n \\nMARK OF THE DEVIL (Sigilium Diaboli) Chant \\n\"Ascend now in the Northern Tower - Horned Lord of the Earth \\nBlessed is the Stave of the Devi\\nl itself, from which we mark \\nourselves in rebirth \\nI come now to behold the Fires from between the Horns of the \\n\\nGoat and stand in the brilliance of Lucifer reborn That we shall \\n\\nrectify the primal dr\\neam of all desire \\nLet this mark be again in the Light of the Sabbat Moon\" \\n\\n The Prayer of the Infernal Sabba\\nt Œ The Devil™s Mark Part Two-  \\nBy the Promethean Torch, known illuminated as Baphomet, the \\n\\nsacred guardian of Azazel, the Hidden Watcher.

The first and \\nforemost being, a direction point of your \\nindividual focus and a means or tool to achi\\neve your Will. The traditional magickal tools \\nare significant to the witch as she/he will de\\nvelop and build each as a part of the self, \\nextensions of your being. \\n \\nDagger-Athame (Will), Wand (Fire), Sword (Air\\n) Chalice (Water) Pentagram (Earth). \\nSuch instruments should be employed during invocations and evocations. Each element \\n\\nwould hold a significant point within the r\\nitual undertaken. For in\\nstance, if one was \\ninvoking Hecate the Pentegram used would be\\n an inverse pentagram, such as the \\nVarcolaci Sigil, while one invoking Babal\\non would implement the Seal of Babalon, \\nknown simply as the seven pointed star of\\n Babalon. The Athame-Dagger, Wand, Sword \\nand Chalice would always be used. Ceremoni\\nal Training is the most demanding in the \\nadvanced study and practice of \\na Warlock or Witch. Each W\\neapon should be consecrated \\nat the appropriate time. The Sword is blesse\\nd by Horus, or Baphomet, the Chalice by \\n  54 54 Hecate or the Goddess of the Sea (Witch Quee\\nn), the Wand by Babalon or another Fire \\nassociated Elemental or spirit, the Pent\\nagram by the Green Man, Pan or the Witches \\nSabbat Goat. Remember success is based upon an intent focus of Will and investment in \\n\\nbelief. Belief, Desire and Will are the \\npower points of success in any working. \\n \\nThe Kangling is an instrument that may \\nbe implemented within your own temple. A \\nkangling is a Tibetan instrument in origin used\\n to call the shades of the dead to feast on \\nyour astral body. This is specifically used in\\n pre-Buddhist Chud rites, which act as an \\nelevation of the spirit into the astral\\n plane, Luciferian sorcery in nature. \\n \\nThe Kangling, made of the human thigh bone, \\nis a shade evoking trumpet used in an \\nancient ritual called ﬁCutting \\nof the Egoﬂ which meant Luciferian ascension through \\ndisassociation. Primarily, the \\ninstrument was developed th\\nrough the Bon Po period of \\nBuddhism. \\n\\n \\nIf one works specifically with the shades or\\n manes of the dead, especially within a \\nWitches Sabbat context, one may wish to obt\\nain a Kapala for the Temple or Coven as \\nwell. The Kapala is a human s\\nkull cap used within rituals as\\n a chalice. In fact, one may \\nuse both a Kapala and a consecrated chalice for the Cup of the Temple. The Kapala is \\n\\nused as an offering bowl in Tibet, in certain\\n tantric rituals spirit\\ns are summoned to feed \\nfrom the contents of the bowl. When filled \\nwith blood, the Kapala is called Ashrakapala, \\nand when filled with flesh is called Mamsakapala. \\n\\n \\nHuman bones also serve as powerful ritual tool\\ns, especially within the path of the Black \\nTemple. While bones are connected as powerful \\nfetish tools, they may also be employed \\nby the sorcerer as tools of ritual and contro\\nlling shades. One may bind demons or spirits \\nto each bone, specifically rib bones as they \\nare shaped properly for using within a wand \\ntype of method. It is possible to\\n bind Goetic Demons or othe\\nr spirits to each rib bone by \\nengraving with a sharp tool th\\ne sigil, using your own blood to \\nbind it and a Goetic ritual \\nof evocation. \\n \\nThe Evocation Dagger is different in severa\\nl aspects from the Anthame, which is the \\nprimary tool of the witch. The Evocation dagg\\ner is used in rituals which involve the \\ncreation, conjuration, binding or banishing of demonic \\nforces. One would use the Evocation Dagger in the rites of creating ng\\nangas, fetishes, spirit pots, necromancy, \\nvampiric servitor creations and some Goe\\ntic workings. The Evocation Dagger should \\nresemble the nature of\\n the rites of which you are workin\\ng, for instance a jagged, cruel \\nlooking blade. You witch name \\nshould be inscribed in Theban on the handle if able and \\nthe knife should undertake the same\\n consecration ritual that \\nthe Anthame will go under.  \\nThe Athame is the weapon of the Holy Guardi\\nan Angel, the Will itself. This blade should \\nrepresent the forces \\nof Angelick guardians of which you\\n should work through. Such will \\nlead you unto a positive flow of\\n mental energy all the while \\nunderstanding the beautiful, and sometimes barbaric forces of darkness w\\nithin you. This is the detailed seperation of \\nthe Holy Guardian Angel and the Evil Genius\\n, from which is described in the ﬁCongress \\ncum Daemoneﬂ ritual of descending into \\nthe core essence of your opposite self. The \\n  55 55 ﬁLuciferian Magickﬂ tome reveals much of\\n the higher work beyond the foundations listed \\nhere. \\n Athame Consecration Ritual  \\nThe Athame is a ritual knife used by w\\nitches as a magickal weapon. The Athame \\nrepresents the imposing will and direction of the witch, the magickal act itself. The \\n\\nAthame is a personal tool and each witch shou\\nld possess one. To consecrate for the self is \\nto create or add to the knife, giving it sacr\\ned meaning in the belief patterns of ritual. \\nAcquire a blade which would be\\n suitable for ritualistic workings, as the Athame is the \\nextension of the magickians will and the fo\\nrcefulness needed in projecting the desire. \\nPaint will be needed to decorate and consec\\nrate the blade and it\\'s handle. Any color \\nwhich holds significance either personally or Qabalistically will do depending on you \\n\\naffinities. I tend to recommend black or red, being two forceful colors which emanate \\n\\nstrength and mystery in themselves. A separa\\nte small knife should also be present for \\ndrawing blood. Three days before conducting \\nthe rite, bury the Athame point down in a \\nsolitary and preferably wooded area. As you \\nbury it, proclaim to yourself in your own \\nway that the blade is being dedicated to the fo\\nrces of nature and the magickal path which \\nyou walk. Three days later, once you unearth \\nthe dagger you will want to consecrate the \\nAthame in a large bowl combined with herbs, your blood and/or sexual fluid as well as \\n\\nwater and salt. \\n\\n \\n \\nWhile consecrating focus and intone: \\n \"Water, Earth and Life where you are cast \\n\\nLet nought unwelcome dare trespass, \\n\\nSo mote it be!\" \\n \\nCast the circle anti-clockwise \\n\\n \\n \"Spirits of fire, water, earth and air, this charge is laid. Let Phantoms of my desire come hence, to which my will is law \\n\\nEcstasy will come and my many Elementals to my aid. \\n\\nSo mote it be!\" \\n\\n  \\nPerform Banishing Ritual \\n\\n \\n \\nOPENING: \\n \\n \"I charge thee with the earth of the great god Pan! \\nI charge thee with the earth from which Belial walks! \\n  56 56 I charge thee with the blood of Hecate! \\nCreation is the birth of the morning, \\n\\nThe clay of flesh formed through any desire of belief! \\n\\nLilith, send your children to my protection \\n\\nAncient ones, spirits of fire, eart\\nh, water and air come forth from \\nthy Aethyrs \\nThis knife wrought of earth, This \\nAthame is to be my magickal \\nweapon. \\nAsmodeus, Watcher of the circle and space beyond, \\n\\nI charge this Athame with \\nyour essence, with my blood \\nFor I am a guardian \\nof true tradition, whose witch blood speaks through me! \\nAMEN!\"  \\nBegin painting the Athame according to your \\ntaste.You may wish to paint sigils or \\ntailsmans or even God signs which hold sign\\nificance to you. Once all is complete take the \\nAthame and intone: \\n\\n \"As the calls of Lilith are hear\\nd, to which Hecate looms forth \\nBy the moon which hangs above \\nI am childe of the Witch moon \\nof Blood \\nHeld by an oath to the shadow, both Dawn and Twilight \\nBy Desire, Will and Belief I mark the path of manifestation. \\n\\nAMEN! So mote it be!\" \\n \\nBanish and close the circle.  The Binding of Shadows \\nA Luciferian Banishing Ritual \\n In silence, close your eyes and envision a la\\nrge amount of energy rising up from within \\nyou. The slow breathing technique\\n, as described by Tantrics \\ndescribed a slow rise of \\nastral energy to form a shield and to clear \\nthe mind of thoughts other than the goals of the \\nrite you will conduct. \\n \\nThe rite as described by Coven Maleficia is \\nbased within the gathering of shadows, the \\nelementals formed in magickal workings to\\n protect the physical \\nand spiritual body from \\nattack. This technique may be used to also clear the mind for the purpose of relaxation. \\n \\nThe shadows, the same of familiars are some \\npart related to the dead, they may be long \\nforgotten shades which are attracted to the \\nspiritual activity of your\\n own magickal work. \\nThey have since lost consciousness and the \\nconcept of ﬁIﬂ, thus proving useful in \\nworkings of magick. \\n Summon them with blood and bones, sexual en\\nergy and the will sharp and focused. They will respond and prove useful guardians while \\nin the astral plane. They feed from our \\n  57 57 lifeforce just as we absorb from the sacred \\nOpfer. Never mind harm, they do not seem to \\ndraw enough lifeforce to cause \\nany alarm of challenge. Thes\\ne shades, if made malicious \\nby destructive black magick, may cause consid\\nerable harm to the intended victim, or \\neven seek havoc upon the caster. Be cautious. It is however mostly a chore to create and \\n\\nempower such elementals that one would be \\nfocused for an extended period of time to \\ncreate such beings. \\n \\nA traditional banishing ritual pr\\noves useful as it allows comp\\nlete control and cleansing of \\nthe individual who performs \\nit. It also, just as anythi\\nng within magick, must mean \\nsomething to the one performing \\nit. This banishing ritual allo\\nws passage from shades into \\nour orbit if you will, while banishing unwante\\nd mental aggravations or unwanted self-\\ncreated or imposed spiritual hindrances. It is \\nalso essential to perform at the beginning \\nand end the each rite, allowing the proper closing in such ceremony. \\n I. The Banishing \\n \\nFacing the altar, lo\\ncated in the East, take the athame \\nand make the sign of an invoking \\npentagram, averse and envision a light \\nemerge from the center of your being. \\n \\nﬂBy the light of Lucifer, born of \\nmy desire for the attainment of \\nbecoming, open the gates of the dead to protect my very being \\n\\nspirit and flesh. Noctifer observe!ﬂ \\n Touch the forehead and recite: ﬁAtehﬂ (unto thee) \\n Facing the North, make the sign of the i\\nnvoking pentagram averse, and envision the \\ngraves of the earth opening forth and en\\ncircling you, protecting you from all outside \\nforms. \\n\\n ﬂBy the light of Azazel, who brought to man and woman the \\n\\nknowledge of the serpent, attend my\\n being in the protection of the \\nkin of Witchblood!ﬂ \\n\\n Touching the genitals recite: ﬁMalkuthﬂ (the kingdom) \\n \\nFacing the West, make the sign of the i\\nnvoking pentagram averse, and envision the \\nwaters circling you, forming great tempests w\\nith serpents and dragons seeking to devour \\nthat which would attack you. \\n ﬁBy the call of Shemyaza may the hidden knowledge and \\n\\nprotection be revealed.

The Circle of the Dead \\n \\nUpon the altar a pre-created Nganga should be with you (creation of ngangas involves the use of human and animal bones-called a fetis\\nh spirit-your blood, sigil, grave soil and \\nsnake skin. This nganga will contain active fetis\\nh spirits related to the dead. You will use \\nitems of the dead which may bring shades or\\n manes of the dead which will allow you to \\nform from your own desire demon servitors \\nof protection. One may fuse animal remains \\nwith human to form half beast elementals, or \\nshades that prove useful in defense. Do not \\nallow conversation of any kind with such created servitors, for that is the road of insanity. Command and Will and allow no argument\\n or discussion with such spirits. \\n \\nFacing the nganga on the altar, take graves\\noil and toss a small amount in the nganga. \\nTake then the vial of blood (of your own \\nblood, nothing else.) and pour a small amount \\non the skull of bones within the nganga. \\n \\nTake the wand, encircling counter-clockwise and intone: \\n ﬁI summon the mighty dead from\\n the spaces of silence from \\nwhich the grave cradles.

The Witches Alphabet, as it is know\\nn, is called Theban. Attributed to Honorius, \\nTheban is an ancient script of runes from \\nwhich the sorcerers of \\nold inscribed many of \\ntheir instruments and the inking of sp\\nells to hide from profane eyes. \\n \\n Invoking the Goddess - Manifestation of the \\nLunar Current  What is the connection between the Zos \\nKia Cultus, Thelema and Witchcraft? The \\nanswer is the Goddess, The All-Prevailing Woma\\nn who is the Avatar of the Gods, bringer of birth, life and death.  Th\\nrough Her Eros and Thanatos \\nare united. The Goddess can \\nassume many guises and forms, Hecate, Lilit\\nh, Kali, Isis and Babalon. In these forms She \\nwill manifest in the Witch. The Witches Sabba\\nt Craft recognizes that the Witch-Goddess \\nis the prime manifestation of individual power\\n and focus upon earth. From the drops of  \\nher menstruation spring all apparent points of inspiration, from thence the fulfillment of  \\n\\nthe Will occurs. To those seeking guidance, the Goddess - once invoked under one of her \\n\\nmany forms - offers an abundance of inspira\\ntion and focus through the dreaming state. \\nBabalon is represented as both beautiful and \\nugly, of night black and fire red. She gives \\nthe flame essence of the great Goddess, he\\nr vehicle upon earth being the Scarlet Woman, \\nthe divine manifestation of lust and strength. There is a well known saying, \\'Behind every grea\\nt man there is a woman\\', indeed, the all \\npervading Woman . Such a sentence can de\\nnote any particular aspect of Woman, \\nmeaning mother, wife, lover, daughter or any \\nfemale identity as She defines Herself. A \\npoint within this phrase is th\\nat the feminine or lunar side\\n of each individual should be \\nwell recognized and explored.  Also that\\n men can learn a lot from women, and on \\nnumerous levels. A balanced relationship provide\\ns a stability in the partners life no matter \\nhow strong the individual is. It is not saying \\nmen are useless, far from it, each should be \\nwilling to listen and learn from one anothe\\nr. There is no stronger union than two who \\nunderstand themselves and their own personal aims and desires. Witchcraft is based upon \\n\\nthe understanding of hidden mysteries and the e\\nffect that responsibility can provide to our fellow human kind. \\n\\n  Lilith  The Mother of the Succubus and of Night,  Lilith is a symbol of night and magickal \\n\\npower, Sorcery and Witchcraft. Her essence is \\nthat of Feminine strength and individual \\nfocus. The connection of Lilith with the cu\\nlt of Vampirism has been noted by many, for \\nthrough the Astral Plane this Goddess manife\\nsts on the Day Side as her fleshing ground. \\nJust as with any pagan goddess or god, Lilith is \\nnot entirely of dark nature, being known \\nas a protectress of mothers and children. The s\\nacred bird of Lilith was the owl,   one may \\n  60 60 seek to invoke, or identify with the godde\\nss Lilith through the dream assumption of the \\nowl form. Such experiments should prove insi\\nghtful. Liliths name was suspected to have \\nderived from the Sumerian Babylonian Belitilli\\n. One rather interesting connection is that \\none of the 17 names of L\\nilith is actually KALI. \\n Kali  \\nKali is the Black Destroyer as well as nurt\\nuring mother. Often represented as a Black \\nDemonic Goddess, Kali stands\\n atop her husband, Shiva, hol\\nding in her hands blades \\ndripping with blood, and upon her neck a necklace\\n of human skulls. Kali is black because \\nall that transpires returns to her, she is th\\ne Abyss in it\\'s feminine aspect. All time melts \\ninto this Goddess. Kali is \\nalso life giving, a nurturing and \\nloving mother, granting ecstasy \\nto those who would invoke her in the rites of Tantra, through which the sexual \\n\\ncombination of opposites set in motion the pr\\nocess of Creation. The union of Male and \\nFemale with a magickal aim or focus presen\\nts an accessible window to the astral and \\ndream plane. Thus through OZ being PAN can \\ndesire become flesh. \\nIt is through the \\ndivine Woman that the essence of Magick \\nand Witchcraft is found. Those seeking beyond this path will often miss it altogether, due to \\nthe consistent denial of ones\\' own feminine \\nor Lunar side which must be invariably\\n joined with the Male or Sun aspect.  BABALON  \\nThe mysteries of Babalon do hold a significan\\nt modern point within some Witchcraft \\ncovens or groups. We must first discover what\\n Babalon was, is and is moving towards to \\nrecognize this brilliant feminine \\nflame within each man and woman. \\n \\nBabalon is the Qabalistically restored spellin\\ng of the biblical Babyl\\non, the great whore. \\nThis goddess is in union with the Beast 666 \\nin the book of revelation. Aleister Crowley \\nrestored the Goddess to her aspe\\nct of holding the cup of her fornications, from which the \\nblood of the saints dwelled. Those who transv\\nerse and persevered through the path of \\nThelema or Holy Magick might offer their bl\\nood to the great Cup, opening themselves to \\nthe glory of Babalon. \\n \\nBabalon is the beautiful goddess of an opened spirit, the Luciferian mind. She is the exact \\nopposite of Mary, for the Christ\\nians Goddess is the mother of\\n the Black Brotherhood of \\nChristianity in many aspects, she is closed \\ntherefore non existent to those who seek the \\nlight of God (Lucifer). \\n \\nJohn Whiteside Parsons wrote much, and dedi\\ncated a majority of his short life to \\nBabalon. Marjorie Cameron Parsons was said to\\n be an avatar of this goddess, and lived \\nher life expressing the importance of i\\nndividual thought and Goddess worship through \\nher art and talks. The Babalon Working, wh\\nich was conducted, by Parsons and the Scribe (his assistant at that time) \\nsought to incarnate Babalon in \\nflesh. Shortly after, Cameron \\narose. \\n   61 61 Babalon is also to be considered a Goddess \\nof death and blood, she \\nis actually a varied \\naspect of Lilith. Babalon may be invoked with\\n a various methods of Sexual Gnosis and \\nblood magick, from which she would incarnate\\n. Those upon the Witches Sabbat path will \\nrecognize the mystery itself, and discover th\\neir own individual path towards her.  \\n Hecate - Queen of Witches- \\n   62 62 The goddess energy, the current empowering our tr\\nadition of the witch cult is channeled \\nthrough the Goddess, Hecate. He\\nr titles are many; The Dark\\n Goddess, Protectress of \\nherds and sailors, Goddess of the Crossroads (which would draw a parallel towards Baron Samedhi of several Voudoo traditions, being the Lord of the Crossroads and the \\n\\nmysteries of Death) as well as the Sender of\\n Nocturnal Visions (Dreaming visitation). \\nHecate is depicted as a woman or hag with th\\nree heads, each facing a different direction. \\nIt is said that Hecate is s\\neen in all three phases of th\\ne moon. Mythology has painted a \\nvision of the Witch Mother with two or sometim\\nes all three heads being that of beasts.  \\nEach animal represents an atavistic desire wh\\nich manifests in her cu\\nrrent of lunar energy. \\nThis power would propel her \\ntowards the goddess incarnatio\\nn of the witch cult and many \\nlines of sorcery. The moon is \\nrepresented as a significant feminine force, based and \\nconnected with the element water. \\n\\nHecate is rumored to be of Thracian origin\\n although her base was within the Roman and \\nGreek pantheons. Though daughter of two light ba\\nsed deities, Perses and Asteria, Hecate \\ndwelled in the underworld along with Hades and Persephone. Her individual powers were discovered through the shadows deep within \\nher own being. Residing with her as well \\nwas Thanatos (God of Death), Hypnos (God of Sleep) and Morpheus (God of Dreams). \\nHecate is known as the Goddess of Witches, be\\ning that of Sorcery and the Cunning Craft. \\nThe aspects of Hecate within Roman and Greek \\nculture show Hecate mostly in a dark or \\nhidden aspect, having three heads (two bei\\nng animal) and three torches. The vehicle \\nwherein she traveled was a chariot guided by several dragons.  \\nA key \\n\\nsignificance of \\nthe dragon is \\n\\nthat such beings \\nare connected to solar and lunar \\neclipses. By an \\n\\neclipse the \\n\\nwater in the \\n\\nlunar sign of \\n\\nCancer is \\n\\naltered in force \\n\\nand substance.  \\n\\nDragons (which \\n\\nis a form the \\nVarcolaci spirits often \\n\\ntake) can \\ntransverse the \\n\\nnight sky, \\n\\ngathering the \\n\\nblood of the \\n\\nmoon. The \\nother aspect of \\n  63 63 Hecate, Diana, is based on the more balan\\nced side of the lunar Goddess. She was the \\nwatcher of mountains, forests, childbirth a\\nnd women.  In her dark aspect she was known \\nas the huntress or destroyer. The Magick Light of Hecate is the backwards or \\'black\\' \\n\\nwisdom of Lucifer, the Morning Star. \\n\\nHecate is the Lunar Mother, to which dream \\nand desire give birth to the flesh of \\nmanifestation. The Gnostic God Lucifer or the \\nMorning Star is the God of the Sun, being \\nof Solar energy. Lucifer\\'s goddess counter part \\nis the Arabian Al-Uzza,  a warrior of the \\nmorning star. A combination of both luna\\nr and solar energy, strength and vision. The Zos Kia Cultus presents the \\'All - Prevai\\nling Woman\\' as a combination of both Hag \\nand young woman. The combination equals experi\\nence and focus with beauty and  grace. \\nThe twin aspects of the Hidden \\'I\\' as AOS te\\nrmed it was a combative instance of  innate \\nsexuality, in which all must be\\n transgressed and explored in \\norder to reach a  higher level \\nof Will and focus. The divine Woman is both beautiful and Ugly, capable of \\n\\ntransformation from a decrepit old woman to\\n a lithe young woman.  Beauty is in the eye \\nof the holder, yet possible through all form\\ns of vision. The Goddess and Woman must be \\nrespected as divine and beautiful, to which a\\nll areas of magickal work be dedicated. All \\nworks to Babalon, Hecate and \\nKali are soaked in blood yet \\nlined with the \\nsoftest silk. Invoke your goddess with will and strength, f\\nacing the devouring fear instinct that \\nemanatates from the Divine Woman. The Th\\nree torches which Hecate carries give light \\nthrough the darkness which she weaves and wa\\nnders in. Light in which those of the \\nWitches Sabbat Tradition dance in astral flesh under a waning moon.The Dark Mother is \\n\\npresent at each dream Sabbat, watching above, \\ngranting her blessings under the Night of \\nPan. \\nThe date of August 13th is sacred\\n to Hecate, it is the traditiona\\nl festival held in her honor \\nwhich dates back to the Roman era. It is historically the same date as the celebration of \\n\\nDiana, who is said to be yet another asp\\nect of the Goddess.The callings of Hecate are a \\nchanneling of lunar energy, to those knowing of\\n their witch blood. A rite such as that \\nfollowing should be held on the eve of the Sabba\\nt as well as August 13th. An example is \\nas follows: \\n\\n \\nBegin with casting the circle, Widde\\nrshins (7)  and banishing ritual.  \"Harmony is born within the circle. \\nWe are joined within this rite \\nas children of the Goddess, sh\\ne who rides the night sky. Thy \\ndance of shadows and dream casti\\nng visions. An ey\\ne which drips \\nthe blood of the moon, to wh\\nich a cloaked night gives compassion. She who holds the spirits who traverse a sky of \\n\\nendless processions... Hark! \\nCome forth, manifest in the power\\n zone of Yesod, in which the \\nrays cascade with silver tones of\\n life.A fire warms the earth in \\nyour honor, to that of amber visions so clear in their ecstasy. \\n\\nWiddershins around a cackling fire, your many children dance, \\n\\nborn of witchblood and invoking the sign of Hecate, Dark \\n\\nGoddess of the Moon. We call your\\n essence down, just as we \\ndance... in spirit... in flesh!! Oh\\n Morpheus, Hypnos and Thanatos \\nyour sight burns with life.We see much through you, desires form \\n  64 64 a transcendent path \\nwithin night.Our spel\\nls weave through your \\narms which hold the sacred\\n fire. So mote it be!!!\"    Hecate The Three Shades of Witch Fire \\nA Rite of Empowerment and the Su\\nmmoning of Her Spirits of Night  Hecate is regarded as the Triple Mooned G\\noddess, the Witch Queen of primal darkness \\nwhom is regarded as Babalon, Lilith and \\nAZ. Hecate is the Goddess of the Crossroads, \\nfrom which one seeks self-initia\\ntion by the congress of her in \\nthe Succubi-Fetish spirit. It is through this communion that \\none enters the caverns of th\\ne night, the very Temple of \\nHecate. Revered as the Goddess of the Dead, \\nshe is the Queen of Ghosts, Shades and \\n  65 65 Phantoms of the night. It is in the center \\nof her essence that one\\n discovers there is no \\ndifference between Hecate and Lilith or Babalon. \\n \\nThis rite of empowerment should be conducte\\nd outdoors if possible, near a grave yard \\nfrom which you would not be disturbed, near\\n an area where you may bury a small box or \\nbottle/pot. A chalice will be needed, pref\\nerably a skull cup/cap if access is had. \\n \\nThis ritual should be conducted when the Moon is Full.  \\nThe vessel for which the famulus (Latin for Familiar) or Succubi/Goddess Fetish may be \\n\\nhoused should be an aesthetic choice, one \\nwhich connects with the feeling of what \\n‚Hecate™ is to you. It is from the wing of the fallen seraph that you create your quill to \\n\\nmark this tomb and fetish-house of the \\nspirit, however it must be prepared. \\n \\n \\nDay ONE- \\nWash the vessel in clean and c\\nool water.

In such a case, you would disp\\nlace your personality \\nvia will long enough to allow this aspect of yourself to take assumption of this energy. \\n   68 68  Baphomet - Horned God of Witches- \\n The eight - sided God, Octinimos, also know\\nn as Baphomet, has significance through the \\ntexts of modern - day Chaos Magick as well as the Witches Sabbat Witchcraft. \\n\\nBaphomet™s eight sides each represent a particul\\nar aspect of  magick. This is a further \\nrepresentation of the connection between the \\nAstral Sabbat (the Dream Conclave) and the \\n  69 69 Day Side (ie Magick) of earthly\\n life. The Day Side being of \\ncourse the fleshing ground of \\nmanifestation. The combination of the two combin\\ned with a system of \\ninspired belief and \\naction represent a state of individual streng\\nth, granting access to the gates of the 93 \\ncurrent which is the vital source of Thelema. \\n\\n \\nIn ﬁDogme et Rituel- Haute \\nMagieﬂ by Eliphas Levi, he de\\nscribes his famous Baphomet \\nimage as the following: \\n\\n \"The goat on the frontispiece carries the sign of the pentagram \\n\\non the forehead, with one point \\nat the top, a sy\\nmbol of light, \\nhis two hands forming the sign of hermetism, the one pointing \\n\\nup to the white moon of Chesed, the other pointing down to \\n\\nthe black one of Geburah. This sign expresses the perfect \\n\\nharmony of mercy with justice. His one arm is female, the \\n\\nother male like the ones of \\nthe androgen of Khunrath, the \\nattributes of which we had to \\nunite with thos\\ne of our goat \\nbecause he is one and the same symbol. The flame of \\n\\nintelligence shining between his horns is the magic light of the \\n\\nuniversal balance, the image of \\nthe soul elevated above matter, \\nas the flame, whilst being tied to\\n matter, shines above it. The \\nugly beast\\'s head expresses the horror of the sinner, whose \\n\\nmaterially acting, solely res\\nponsible part ha\\ns to bear the \\npunishment exclusively; because the soul is insensitive \\n\\naccording to its nature and can only suffer when it \\n\\nmaterializes. The rod standing in\\nstead of genitals symbolizes \\neternal life, the body covered with scales the water, the semi- \\ncircle above it the atmosphere, \\nthe feathers following above \\nthe volatile. Humanity is represented by the two breasts and \\n\\nthe androgen arms of this sphinx of the occult sciences.\" \\n \\nThe mentioning of the flame between the ho\\nrns as symbolizing \\nthe magic light of \\nuniversal balance, is rather significant with\\n the mentioning of th\\ne soul being elevated \\nabove matter (Lucifer) and the flame being ti\\ned to matter shines above it (Satan). \\n \\nThe manifestation of the Holy Guardian Ange\\nl (The True Will, the hidden genius and the \\nspirit of light) is also th\\ne result of invocation and desi\\nre made flesh. The two human \\naspects of the Witches Sabbat Goat (Baphomet)\\n are represented in th\\ne Female (the Moon \\n- Witchcraft and Sorcery: strength in mind, \\nthe dream state, desire initializing belief \\nwhich manifests towards strength and ultim\\nately attainment.) and Male (Sun, Magick: \\nmanifestation, strength in flesh and action). \\n\\nWithout one the other is nothi\\nng. The goat aspect equates w\\nith the Qabalistic number 77, \\nmeaning buck/goat/devil thus representing fert\\nility, creation, life and unrestrained sexual \\nforce. This is parallel with the basis of\\n desire equaling action, having its basis in a \\nsexually driven subconscious beginning, even\\n though the desire obtained may not be sex \\nrelated. \\n  70 70  The serpent aspect is represented \\n\\ntraditionally as Kundalini, the fire snake \\n\\nin the form of a phallus, being a means \\n\\nof infinite manifestation. To awaken \\n\\nKundalini is to begin the process of \\n\\ndesire and the ID (the driven magickal \\n\\npoint of will). The hands of Baphomet \\n\\npoint one towards the sky and one \\n\\ntowards the Earth. The meaning of such \\n\\nis \\'As above so below™ for balance is a \\n\\nkey to the individual attainment of \\n\\nLucifer\\'s Grail (Light, wisdom and \\n\\nmanifestation, ultimately \\n\\nenlightenment). The winged aspect is \\n\\nsymbolic of Night - \\nflight, giving an \\nindication of the significance of the \\n\\nLunar Dream State in the Witch Cult. \\n\\n \\nThe Witches Sabbat Goat or Baphomet \\n\\nis known as the God of Witches, being \\n\\nthe sigil of desire + \\nwill = manifestation. \\nThe Night Side holds all \\ngreat mysteries of the \\nself. The result of exploration of the self in all \\nforms will allow one to discover and come to \\n\\nterms with all aspects of the individual, both \\n\\npositive and negative. The goal being ultimately \\n\\nto discover and pursue ones True Will. \\n\\nThe True Will manifests in the Day Side (5) \\n\\nthrough Magick. The strength needed to push \\n\\nforward and let nothing \\nstand in your way is \\nrealized through experien\\nce and the will for a \\ngood fight. Baphomet holds higher initiation \\n\\nwithin Luciferian Magick, from which shall not \\n\\nbe revealed here. \\n \\nBaphomet may also be considered the God of \\n\\nKnowledge, bringing the balance between the \\n\\naspects of Satan (Earth Mastery, Lord Shaitan) \\n\\nand Lucifer (Air, astral projection/mastery) and \\n\\nthe unity of the twin aspects of Lilith (Earth, \\n\\nNight and Witchcraft) and BABALON (Fire, \\n\\nHigh Magick Art).  \\nThe invocation to Baphomet is a lunar/solar \\nopening to the mysteries of the Night Side \\nand the fleshing Day Side.   71 71   Invocation of Baphomet  \"O fire of the Black One, illuminate by thy dark presence, \\n\\nLet my strength come forth.  I am stripped and defaced, \\n\\nTo reveal the true self, and its ever changing essence Which truth may not be rendered without falsehood. \\n\\n \\nFrom Sabbath flame to witching\\n mire, as we fly through the \\nNight \\nLet Baphomet be my guide, with Thy torch of dark illumination. \\n\\nBearer of Black Wisdom of the Sp\\nirit, God of Beasts and God of \\nFlight \\nCast unto me this night an embe\\nr from the Fire of Thy Wisdom. \\n \\nTo Believe!

Asmodeus is \\nmentioned frequently in Hebrew texts. \\nThe Goetia of Solomon the King gives a \\ndescription of the form which Asmodeus ta\\nkes when appearing before the sorcerer:  \\nThree headed (a connection with Hecate, bein\\ng the tripled nature \\nof the moon), a ram, \\nhuman and bull, Asmodeus rides upon a dr\\nagon, vomits fire \\nand carries a spear. The association of Asmodeus with witchcraft \\nbeyond the Triple Mooned nature is that the Daemon is said to be the child of Tubal - Cain and Naamah, given life by the reverse \\n\\naspects associated with witchcraft and demonol\\nogy.  These \\'reverse aspects\\'  refer to his \\ntitle as a \"Demon of Impurity\" \\n(The Book of the Sacred Magi\\nck of Abramelin the Mage\" \\ntranslated by Macgregor Mathers) which  signi\\nfies the horrors (by Christian doctrine) of \\nastral copulations which occur at the Witches\\' Sabbat. \\nSuch copulations occur once \\nthe individual creates and charges Elementals evoked for \\nthis specific purpose on the material plane. \\nIt is not always advisable to evoke such \\nElementals while not consecrating or bindi\\nng them, such if not controlled can cause \\nundesirable effects. Asmodeus in the doctrine of the Witches Sabba\\nt or Witch Cult is the lord of the circle, \\nwithin which full  attainment and union occurs. The Lord of the Circle is also the Lord of \\n\\nSorcery. Asmodeus can be a powerful guide from \\nthe gate of the flesh, or earth, to that of \\nChoronzon. Approach this Daemon with caution, \\nfor there can be hell to pay if any spirit \\nis invoked without care. \\n\\n     \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n   73 73  Shaitan  -The Adversary which developed \\n\\nfrom the Lord of Storms and Prince \\n\\nof Darkness, Set. In the Islamic \\n\\nTradition (ahadith), Shaitan/Satan is \\n\\nAzazel, the Lord of Djinn whom is \\n\\nmade from Fire, thus a source of \\n\\nLight unto itself. Azazel/Shaitan is a \\n\\nfallen angel, the first angel who \\n\\npreached to the other angels in pre-\\n\\neternity. Shaitan is also Melek \\n\\nTa™aus, the Peacock Angel. \\n\\n Samael  \\nSamael in Hebrew texts is the \\n\\nhusband of Lilith, the father of Cain. \\n\\nSamael is of Fire and of Night, from \\n\\nwhich all daemonical energy is \\n\\nderived. When accepting both Lilith \\n\\nand Samael into your mind, into your \\n\\nspirit, one must be certain of the \\n\\nwitch blood which runs through your \\n\\nveins. Each God and Goddess grants \\n\\na fuel to the gnosis, but also forms \\n\\nthe subconscious and conscious \\n\\naccording to their own shape and \\nform. Samael is the great serpent of \\nbiblical lore, born \\nof fire and taught \\nby the words of Belial. Within the Witch Cult these Daemonical forces are of great \\n\\nsignificance and benefit to th\\ne sorcerer who can control \\nand utilize such god forms. \\nSamael is often refered to as Asmodeus as we\\nll, while this may actually be its off spring, \\nguiding humans through the magickal ar\\nts in spirit form upon the earth. \\n Divination \\n \\nWitchcraft and sorcery concern the tapping in\\nto the subconscious; learning the ways in \\nwhich it works in regards to you personally \\nand making them accord to your desire. The \\nbalance of this exists within the Shaman a\\nnd Nature bound activities,\\n for Nature is the \\nmother of all humanity. To open psychic levels\\n of the mind requires a conscious effort to \\nbreak all levels of useless learned behavi\\nor and thought patterns. Then one can then \\nrestructure aligned with the development and \\nunderstanding of psychi\\nc abilities. Some of \\nthese abilities can be brought to the su\\nrface by intense yoga, pushing the self both \\n  74 74 mentally and physically until the true streng\\nths and weaknesses are known and dealt with. \\nDivination is the art of obtai\\nning visions of  a certain po\\nssible event that will take \\nflesh.The witch cult which exists in base on the astral and dream level seem to be fueled \\n\\nby an even older current. This particular curr\\nent is labeled as the \\n93 current, or Thelema. \\nLove and Will are the two keys by which manki\\nnd can rise above any situation to begin \\nbuilding a healthy and wonderful life. To do s\\no, one must plunge into the great depths of \\nthe Abyss and work with the beautiful and \\nsometimes frightening shades and spirits \\nwhich inhabit such areas. Self  Love as AOS \\ndescribed is \"the self\\n in knowing and all of \\nwhich can be molded according to desire.\" \\n(6) To truly know the self one must plunge \\ndeep into the mirror and face the demons \\nand gods within. The actual development of \\npsychic abilities are of two kinds primarily: \\n\\n \\nA) being self taught or as some called a \"gift\" \\n\\n \\nB) practicing and unleashing such an instin\\nctual power.  \\nWhether individuals are self taught, or have a \\nnatural gift  from a young age, they have a \\ntalent for having visions or be\\ning able to foresee events a\\nnd future happenings. Some are \\nable to see what was, which could open ment\\nal doors to ghosts and other such specters, or \\nto see things which could come to pass. I\\nndividuals who are self \\ntaught by practicing \\nopening the subconscious door to work with su\\nch abilities often gr\\now stronger by their \\nvisions, which are similar to those born to \\nsuch ability. While results are similar, \\ntechniques are as different \\nas the people who work them. \\nI am describing such a method \\nwhich holds some significant result\\ns for those able to develop it.  \\n Divination by Water \\n \\nA fairly large glass bowl should be obtaine\\nd, which the individual should fill half full \\nwith water. This should be done in the setti\\nng of a room suited to\\n fit the frame of mind \\nrequired. Incense, herbs, candles and musi\\nc could benefit the mind set required. The \\nwitch now seeks to become entranced by whatever means permits the mind freedom to \\n\\naccess its own psychic influences. Forget ev\\nerything which is outside your door, forget \\nthe people, cars, animals barki\\nng, etc. until one is able to \\nfocus intently upon the interior \\nworld of the mind. The subconscious should be \\nactivated by an inspirational symbol or \\nsigil which should already be consecrated. Perhaps it \\nis a talisman for knowledge, \\ndivination, happiness, etc.., any of which can  work to the best suited means. \\nIf the witch is attempting to \\nread the fortune of another, \\nshe/he should sit the individual \\ndown across from them, so they can also view\\n the water within the bowl. The witch will \\nfocus upon the water as a great current of Witches Sabbat energy, fueled by the waves of \\n\\nthe Abyss and all that emanat\\nes from her/his subconscious. The individual will ask a particular question of the witch, who will begin focusing and \\n\\nconcentration on the water. Images will begin to\\n appear in the surface that will in some \\nway reveal the answer they \\nrequire. If the witch is unabl\\ne to make the individual see \\nthem, as some are unable to do, then the witc\\nh should describe the scene in detail to the \\nperson having the reading done. Some are able to make images appear in water, which all \\n  75 75 can see and some are only able to make th\\nem appear to themselv\\nes. There are numerous \\nother kinds of divination methods one can \\npractice, many will work for the individual \\nwhile others may not. \\n\\n Candle Magick  \\nThe use of candle in ritual is\\n a proven technique of allowing \\nthe mind to enter the states \\nby which the subconscious is able to work it\\'\\ns will. I have mentioned the use of sigils \\nwhich signify the desire in disguised fashi\\non. Candle magick is a system of symbols and \\ndesire transformed into a particular item. One example of their use is in ritual. One \\nshould use the particular color which represen\\nts a certain desire, such as the following \\ncolors. It is recommended that you should use the colors as they suit you, based on your \\n\\nindividual interpretations of such.  \\n Black : Hidden Knowledge, Death,  Change and Defense \\n \\nRed:  Creativity, Love, Attraction, Vitality, War and Aggression  \\nWhite: Purity, Cleansing, Protection \\nand  Bestowing Health to Another \\n \\nBlue: Happiness, Work (Obtaining Job, Change of Career) and Friendship  \\nYellow: Health, Happiness, Wits and Alertness = Intuition, \\n\\n \\nGreen: Money, Success and Material Items \\n\\n \\nOrange: Endurance, thought, and inspiration. \\n \\nPurple: Sex and Rejuvenation.   \\nThis is a list of the possible influences and \\nsignificance that each color holds. It could be \\nthat the sorcerer develops his or her own \\ndetailed system of intermixing color and \\ncombining them with the burning of candles\\n. Some examples could be the following: \\nIf one was seeking to create or evoke a su\\nccubus or sexual servitor one could burn the \\ncolors of both Red and Purple,  together wi\\nth incense and using suitable invocations and \\nsigils/talismans, such could prove a powerful sp\\nell. If one was seeki\\nng to battle another \\nthe colors of Black and Red \\nwould be implemented along w\\nith invocations of numerous \\ndaemonic servitors created and evoked especi\\nally for the purpose of destroying the \\nenemy with a lightning swift strike. If one was \\nseeking to attract a suitable partner/lover \\none may wish to burn the colors of Blue (fri\\nendship), Red and Purple. If one sought to \\nhelp a sick friend the color combination of \\n Yellow and White would be of interest, of \\ncourse Orange and Blue would be an excel\\nlent idea as well. The candle should a large \\nround one, allowing it to burn for several hours. Many small taper candles will burn out \\n\\nwithin one hour so those are not advised. Th\\ne intent of the wish should be heavily \\n  76 76 visualized in sigil form once the candle is \\nlit, as it slowly burns focus upon the wish \\ncoming to flesh. This would give the brain  av\\nenues to obtain its i\\nnner desire through the \\nmedium of a coded (i.e. colored) object, gi\\nven significance according to the definition of \\nthe color used in reference to your mental definition. \\n\\nThe candle should be burnt for as long as po\\nssible, the focus fading as the candle burns \\nout. By the extinguishing of the flame, the mi\\nnd should be tired of it, enough to forget it. \\nIf not, a forced passing should be implemen\\nted to the best of your ability. Try other \\nmeans such as a long bath, sleep or another \\nactivity while the candle burns, enough to \\nissue the focused energy through the candle \\nwhile actually doing \\nsomething you greatly \\nenjoy. Do not let activity hinder your magick, let it enhance it accordingly. \\n\\n Spell of Making \\n \\nThis is a practice of making, which could be\\n used in almost any manner the sorcerer \\ndesires. Such could be for the destruction of \\nan intended victim, for the obtaining of love \\nor friendship, for the wish of health to a l\\noved one, etc. There are really no boundaries for \\nsuch a working as this. The Spell of Making involves a mental image and the Will of the \\n\\nsorcerer to be successful. One obtains a bl\\nack box to store objects representing the \\nindividual on whom the rite is focused. Ob\\njects which are recommended are a sample of \\nwriting, a piece of the individual\\'s clothes, \\na photograph or drawing, in fact anything \\npersonal which grants you a connection wi\\nth them. Store these objects in the box you \\nhave procured for these items. Then you  focus your entire Will on the desire and it\\'s \\n\\ncoming to pass. Some develop a mantra which th\\ney recite over and over to themselves, to \\nfurther secure the desire coming to flesh.  Th\\ne box should be simply allowed to sit, and is \\nkept while you visualize the objects in the \\nbox upon each day that passes. Do not disturb \\nit, simply allow it to sit and build it\\'s \\nenergy as you continually focus upon it for a \\nmoment each day. Once you feel an amount of\\n tension has lessened, you should destroy \\nthe entire box, every item within it as well. A small fire is ideal. While the fire is burning \\n\\nthe contents visualize your Ids \\nto carry the desire \\nunto it\\'s destination, to\\n fulfill the desire. \\nOnce the fire has destroyed the \\nbox and it\\'s contents, forget a\\nbout it entirely. This allows \\nthe intent to derive a consistent source of\\n psychic energy, activated\\n via the subconscious, \\nto seek forth it\\'s mission and make it come to flesh. \\n\\n    77 77     \\n     \\n   \\n   \\n   \\n The Sabbats  The eight Witches™ Sabbats listed herein are pr\\nesented in Gaelic. The purpose of this is to \\nrecognize the great Celtic her\\nitage which is present in th\\ne craft and its blood. Our whole \\nexploration and the system with\\nin our work is based upon the \\nCeltic system of the four \\n‚Greater™ Sabbaths. These are: Imbolg, Beltane, Lughnasadh and Samhain, while the \\n\\nEquinoxes and Solstices are Spring, Summer, Au\\ntumn and Yule tide. These are times of \\nshifting forces, when the witch draws great pow\\ner from the earth that\\n can be distilled by \\nthe control of the will. Such powers are fleeting, so each sorcerer must capture and \\n\\nemploy what they can while they can. The Sa\\nbbaths are a time of gathering with ones™ \\nfamily, both on the earth and on the astral plan\\ne. The disciplines of the Dream Sabbat are \\nnot an easy or uninitiated task. Much contro\\nl and advanced knowledge\\n and practice must \\nbe instilled in order for the w\\nitch or warlock to take to th\\ne dream flesh. Be sure though, \\nthe sorcerer who can leave the flesh and journey throughout the night and Da™ath is a \\n\\ndangerous and powerful magickia\\nn, but also vulner\\nable to more malefic forces if Will \\nand discipline are not implemented. Proceed wi\\nth caution and care, for there is a wolf in \\nthe garden of Eden. \\n The Witches Sabbat Shadows cas\\nt are but initiation points \\nof which we open forth the \\ngates of dreams, that waking and dreaming st\\nate of which we shall become in an all \\nencompassing arcana of self. \\n  78 78  Imbolg  February 2nd. \\n \\nThis festival is of fire. The \\npowers of fire reside in crea\\ntion and destruction, the flames \\neither caress or break down. If at all possibl\\ne, this rite should be\\n conducted outdoors, \\nproviding room for an ample fire. If not, \\na well decorated chamber adorned with the \\nimages of fire and sleep. \\nImbolg is represented as the first stirring of\\n Spring within the womb of the Earth. This \\nrite is a celebration of the comi\\nng of light, therefore \\nof great inspiration \\nleading in reverse towards the moon. A sigil of astral rising shoul\\nd be consecrated by the sorcerer or witch, \\nand then laid upon the altar for each coven \\nmember to focus upon. The sigil should be \\nabsorbed in the mind, becoming all things of \\nwhich there is a creative spark or flame. \\nImbolg is the fire festival of Lilith Œ Babalon in her Luciferic Solar Essence, it is the \\n\\nemergence from the dark of Winter Œ the very\\n first signs of the coming of Spring and Her \\nKing, Lucifer. Around the time of Imbolg one ma\\ny summon forth the essence of Lucifera \\nŒ Lilith as the Goddess which bears the fruit of the earth, Cain. Implements which provide useful visualizati\\nons are the Athame (each witch within the \\nrite should  possess one), sword, incense bur\\nner, consecration flui\\nd (a bottle of the \\nsorcerers\\' blood, not ANIMAL blood mind you, \\nspecifically the life fluid of your very \\nown self.)   All Sabbat rites should be opened with the Witches\\' Sabbat text, adapted from \\nAO Spare\\'s ritual (8), proving most eff\\nective for those of burgeoning inspiration. The particular version of the Witches\\' Rune \\npertaining to Coven Nachttoter is as follows: \\nSuch words  I advise be altered to suit the individual working such rites. \\n Witches Rune  \"Bagabi lacha bachabe lamac cahi achababe \\n\\nTo that which is, unto that which was... \\nA burning cycle is upon us, fear shan™t ascend in its ugliness, failure is null, nothing is true. \\nCast my earth and rise unto the shadow \\n\\nShining moon and velvet night I ra\\nise the witches\\' blade and give \\nthee life \\nCome unto us this dark night! \\n\\nSouth, East, West and North thy spirit come forth in joy \\nA fire from the spinning sun \\nwheel, Birth is through blood\"   Sabbath Rite  \"Mother of shadows, Crone of \\nwisdom, Oh Goddess of the blood \\nmoon, \\nReversed matter, I evoke thee unto this celebration.   79 79 Blessings to those of blissful \\necstasy which all derives from \\nHecate, \\nAscend from the depths of Night, to join your great sister of \\n\\nmagick; \\n\\nLilith, she who haunts the dreams of Man, be present in our \\nleitmotif of desire. \\n\\nAmenﬂ \\n\\n \\nﬁI conjure thee, circle of power\\n unto which the wind carries our \\nwill! \\nAsmodeus, behold an ascending lig\\nht burning gold transcending \\nall points of time, we are becoming as the one called Morning \\n\\nStar of the east, blinding light of birth! Io Horned God of Wisdom!\" \\n\\n  Spring Equinox \\nMarch 21st \\n \\nThe Spring Equinox is the dawning of light and birth, of renewal and energy. Spring is \\n\\nthe time of PAN and of the Morning Star (9\\n). All beasts and men/\\nwomen walk the earth \\nin awakened senses, especially those of a magi\\nckal path. This is a \\nrite of exploring the \\nparallel path ways, similar to the spheres of\\n shadow conscious or the tunnels of Night.  \\nBalance is defined in this season and both \\nlight and shadow, black and white... all of \\nwhich becomes itself in reverse. The sorcerer \\nshould approach this rite as a dawning of \\ntheir senses, of which wit and thought will pr\\nevail in the well balanced individual. The \\nWill itself is tested in this aspect. Pan is represented and hidden as Pan, the child of \\n\\nSamael and Lilith. Pan/Cain take\\ns many forms, in the Spring \\nhe is the Wild Beast who is \\nHunter, horned and decorated in the colors of the earthen flesh. \\n \\nPreparation \\n \\nA reverse traditional sun wheel should be \\nhung above the altar, \\nrepresenting the light which breaks through the night itself in turn to return to da\\nrkness. This symbol is eternal, \\nnever breaking from this cycle of destructi\\non and creation. The essence of spring lies in \\nthe ideal of birth and new breath, in which a\\nll new things emerge from the earth. The \\ntraditional Athame and such should be present. \\n\\nIt is advised to approach this rite with ex\\ntreme care and practice individual control, PAN \\nawaits your PANIC, your LUST and awak\\nening. May PAN be as your brother, your \\nguide, not your doom. Those who allow one particular imbalanced side to manifest will \\n\\nbe victim of such a self-created destructi\\non cycle. The circle should be drawn and the \\nproper invocations performed, intent should \\nbe pure and of great strength in each \\nindividual performing. The Morning Star is \\nbeing invoked for the sense of Luciferian \\nLight and beauty, to dispel that which is of \\nill intent. To understand the essence of the \\nMorning Star, one must break down the perverse\\n myth created by the writers of the Bible \\nfor its devil created of such a Light Symbol. \\n  80 80  \"To the East, O Morning Star of wisdom and light! \\n\\nUnto Lilith of Night Black, I \\ninvoke the power of shadow and \\nlight of which all that passes from each fountain shall know the \\n\\nbalance of life, Come forth, th\\ne wheel spins and many are born, \\ndeath is null and life is ecstasy. \\nLet thy star guide us in passion \\nand focus, let that which should harm be cast away! So mote it \\n\\nbe!!\"  \\nSuch recitals of \"Hymn to Pa\\nn\" by Aleister Crowley is su\\nggested, the beauty and power \\nassociated with this invocation/poem is legendary. \\n\\nAn associated Coven Maleficia /Coven Nachttoter chant is as following: \\n \"PAN, IO PAN! God of forest and God of Life, Shadowy and \\n\\nBestial, Flesh in Fire, Flesh in Ea\\nrth, To the field and forest! Cast \\nthy ecstasy into our presence, dwell within our veins and heart, \\n\\nspirit and flesh! Let us know your beauty!! PAN, IO PAN!!!\" \\n \\nEach member should be rapidl\\ny excited by dancing at their \\nown individual frantic pace, \\nuntil images of the Morning Star (of which \\nI recommend Paintings of Lucifer by German \\narchitect Fidus ) and Pan (10) (see Rosaleen \\nNorton) dance freely in the spirit, a raging \\nfire in the heart and the Sun \\nWheel burns a golden red. Th\\ne rite should end with the \\nWitches\\' Sabbath and then a banishing. Th\\nen  each and every member should try and \\nretire to sleep at the same time to attend a group Sabbath. \\n Beltane April 30th \\n \\nBeltane is known primarily as a Celtic holida\\ny, translating to \\'Bel \\nFire\\'. A God of light \\nand fire, Bel also represented the shadow \\nside, often connected \\nwith Cernunnos. Beltane \\nis a gathering of the rising Sp\\nring, when birth is abundant a\\nnd life awakes in its fragile \\nbeauty. The night is the gateway to dream\\ns, through which we take flight blown by \\nfervent winds in the direction of the Sabbat. As the flames burn high towards a waning \\n\\nmoon, so does inspiration and \\nthe shadows of those who shed their flesh. The key lies \\nwithin a dreaming and waking world dependent on the friction of desire and will. Will \\n\\nyou not open an eye to the possibilities available only in dream? Nothing is true, \\n\\nunderstand this and the key is\\n awakened in that instant.\\n Between each \\nline there is transition, the moment that young woman beco\\nmes hag and hag beco\\nmes woman. All is \\nbeautiful in the instant in which lightning st\\nrikes. Burn with passion according to your \\ndesire, so the flames leap to height\\ns seldom reached. Ecstasy is belief. \\n Midsummer JUNE 22nd  This is a calling and celebration of the warm\\nth of the sun, an invoc\\nation of passion and \\nlife giving pleasure. Lugh, the Celtic Light Bri\\nnger is of radiant color, his image is \\n  81 81 painted in the mind during this \\nperiod. The magickal weapon of\\n this particular Sabbat is \\nthe Lamp. 26 is the number of the Witches\\'\\n Sabbat as well as Satyrs and Fauns, Panic \\nDemons (11) the children of PAN. It is said th\\nat Pan is present at each Sabbat, just as the \\nsigil of desire which is the Goat Headed figure or Black One is.  A circle should be drawn by the members of the temple of group, who fr\\nequently take a collective name significant \\nin relation to these gods and ot\\nher entities. The ritu\\nal of Dawn is s\\nuggested, however the \\nactual Sabbat text should be focused \\nupon during the evening hours shortly before sleeping. \\n  Lughnasadh July 31st  \\nLugh is a Celtic god of Light and Fire, connect\\ned to, by the essence of the form, to \\nLucifer. \\nIt is rumored that the name Lugh is derived \\nfrom the Latin word LUX, meaning \\'light\\'. \\nSuch a Sabbat is a celebration of not only the \\nhidden light (ie. Morn\\ning Star and wisdom) \\nbut the Moon as well. Lughnasa\\ndh has its roots primarily with\\nin the Celtic \\nculture which \\nlater surfaced and transferred \\ninto what is now known as the Independent Witches Sabbat \\nWitchcraft and Wicca. The essence of this Sa\\nbbat is the brightness of the sun and the \\nbeauty of nature in its living aspect. \\nLucet/Lucifer is Azazel \\nthe Fire Djinn, he who is brought unto earth wearing the Emerald \\nCrown. \\nLugh is represented as the leader of Tuatha\\n De Danann which transl\\nates \"People of the \\nGoddess Dana\". The people of Ireland record a \\ngreat battle in their \\nancient texts between Lugh and Tuatha De Danann against the Fomo\\nrs and their leader, Balor. Lugh and his \\npeople were victorious, thus \\nbanishing the Fomors further \\nwithin the shadows in which \\nthey dwelt. Approach the festival of \\nLughnasadh as though you were drawing down the \\nmoon of Hecate, breed the thoughts and desi\\nres which shall come to pass. A willow \\nwhich drapes towards the earth will inherent\\nly guide you until a new sight is gained from \\nthe shadows of your shape. You will undergo, as did Lugh, death and rebirth, therefore be \\nrobed in white at first, then\\n black. A reversal is essentia\\nl for the understanding that all \\nthings have two natures inherently. All acti\\nons and symbols must be trespassed to gain \\nthe insight of mind-flight (the dream). \\n\\n Autumn Equinox September 21st \\n\\n \\nAs the two equinoxes are known for the balan\\nce and equilibrium of both black and white, \\nso is the birthing of your inner strengths an\\nd insight, which develop with every Equinox \\nthat passes. In the old times, when the tr\\nadition flourished from \\ntongue to mind, so did \\nthe growing psychic strength of the witch. This \\nis still the case, with slight differences \\ndue to the modern view point and increase \\nof information. The energies available are \\nbalanced positive and negative, thus eminently suited for growth. The renewed tradition \\n\\nnow opens doors to the mind unknown for thousands\\n of years. We are relinked with the \\n  82 82 sorcerers of Babylon and Egypt, who passed on the cups of witch blood to those \\npsychically connected or of \\nlineal descent. Rites on the \\nEquinox should be employed to \\nbenefit the coven or individua\\nl witch, so that balance is \\nachieved. These goals have \\nplentiful magickal energy to employ, will an\\nd Athame - the cause of change and passion! \\nApproach the Equinox with the Witches Rune \\nand, according to your atavistic desires and \\nAncient gnosis of memories, explore and rejoi\\nce! This rite sees a change of emphasis \\nfrom the Life giving Sun to the height of th\\ne Moon in it\\'s death aspect. All things return \\nto black just as black gives birth to light. \\nGive farewell to the Sun and welcome forth the \\nMoon which rises as the twilight approaches. Th\\ne dead rise as the leaves fall, making \\nway for the funeral fires of Samhain! \\n\\n Samhain October 31st \\n \\nOf the dead who dance a leaf blown dance towards the fires; \\nOf the spectral hands which caress the sleep autumn; \\nWe come of graves yet unknown of\\n sight and filled in tunnels \\nOf crimson, as the torch which leads our very essence - \\n\\nOne behind and one ahead both moving forwards and backwards; \\n\\nAt the same time of names ye already know... \\n\\nNever to remind as she dances upon a lovelorn tomb. \\n\\n \\nJust as May Eve is the light bringing birt\\nh of summer, so comes the shadow side and \\nreverse, being the coming of th\\ne dead in the Night of Pan. Samhain is the most significant \\nto our sorcery, being a portal in nature to \\nthe shadows cast by the great torch of Hecate \\nand Lilith.  It is when we shed our skin to \\nthe skies of twilight, and rise to flight among \\nthose of Black Eagle (12). This is the time of\\n the shadow current of witchcraft in which \\nwe exist by our own Ids and desires, by our will and strength alone. This is the birth \\n\\n(November 1st) of the Celtic winter, when th\\ne dead walk between th\\ne paths of twilight \\nand dawn. From our day side to what shall be\\n our night side: this is the night when the \\ndead come to dance! When vampiric flesh a\\nnd atavistic ecstasies ar\\ne known to those of \\nour blood. Many shall paint upon th\\neir flesh the sigil of Varcol\\naci, of drinki\\nng from the \\nmoon. The \\'Feile na Marbh\\' (translated \\'Feasts\\n of the Dead\\')  is upon us, take more of \\nyour fill of desire! \\n\\n \\nPreparation \\n \\nAs it is a feast of the dead, you of the bl\\nood surely know your role! To be clothed in \\ncerements of the grave and of the most beau\\ntiful colors, being black and crimson, purple \\nand white! The cauldron should be prepared wi\\nth all herbs and potions in which you are \\nable and knowledgeable. Drops of\\n your blood should be added \\nas a gift to the dead. The \\nnight of vampiric rising and shape shifting has highest priority, revel and bask in the great \\nglory that your very blood is of Hecate! \\n\\n \\nA bonfire should feature if outdoor\\ns in seclusion, a blaze to mi\\nrror the great Sabbath feast \\nof the spirit. \\n  83 83  The rite should open with the Witches Rune and then intone: \\n\\n \"Samhain, great god of the dead to which the veil is lifted: \\n\\nWe call those of our blood, with our many desires, to walk! \\n\\nAzazel, from the hidden forests of thy Seraphim walk, \\n\\nTo live within every grave, from which we too are come; \\n\\nand stalk with us the skies by night! \\nThis is our passion of shadows and of night, \\nSo our eyes burn as does Thy Great Fire, Thou that Revealest, Thou that Becometh!\" \\n \\nCelebrate with such a fury and rising ecstasy \\nas is not seen of men. This shall be your \\nwill and wish. \\n\\nEmbrace your lover and friends as one; to them and to you are given joy! Behold, the \\n\\nhooves of the goat are behind thee and ahead \\nof thee, knowing the step you are taking. \\nThere is a key here, learn of it what is in your\\n very heart! Mask your\\nself in the paint of \\nthe dead or of the spirit you are! Abandon yourse\\nlves to the freedom of the flying flesh! \\nIf indoors, let billows of incense smoke f\\nill the chamber; then with invocations and \\nevocations, callings and banishings l\\nearn from the dead what ye will. \\n \\nContact via Ouji boards as trivia\\nl as it may sound can be of use, as are room recorders to \\ncapture any messages from the dead. Upon th\\ne closing of the grea\\nt celebration, banish and retire to sleep and to dream. Shed your sk\\nin as the Serpent of \\nthe forest and fly upon \\nbroom or animal... take to the skies and f\\neast of the funereal \\ndead! They are your \\nbeginnings and the infinite possibility.   Yule \\nDecember 22nd \\n\\n \\nThe Winter Solstice is the time that marks th\\ne death and rebirth of \\nthe Sun God. It is a \\ntime of contemplation, of self-examination and \\nnatural rebirth.  Yule also is the birthday \\nof Mithras (13), the Sun God of Persia. The \\nbirth data of the Chri\\nstian savior was not \\naccurately known from their historic te\\nxts per se, however around AD 273 that the \\nChurch and its officials aligne\\nd the birth of Christ to ab\\nsorb the Pagan Gods of old \\n(Mithras, etc). \\n\\nThe moon of December is known as the Wo\\nlf Moon, Oak Moon which refers to the \\nbirthing of new life, to which the balance \\nof nature grows strong. The great Oak tree \\nreaches high into the material world while \\nhaving it\\'s roots deeply planted within the \\nearth. The purest rite consists\\n of a clear and awakened mind, in which a new birth shall \\narise. \\n \\nThe Witches\\' Sabbath \\n\\n   84 84 \"O self my God, foreign is thy \\nname except in blasphemy, for I \\nam thy iconoclast. I cast thy bread upon the waters, for I myself \\n\\nam meat enough. \\n\\nHidden in the labyrinth of the al\\nphabet is my sacred name, the \\nSIGIL of all things unknown. On \\nEarth my kingdom is Eternity \\nof DESIRE. My wish incarnates in the belief and becomes flesh, \\n\\nfor, I AM THE LIVING TRUTH. Heaven is ecstasy; my \\n\\nconsciousness changing and acqui\\nring association. May I have courage to take from my own \\nsuper~abundance. Let me forget \\nrighteousness. Free me of morals.

Let \\n\\nme sin against the small beliefs.- AMEN.\" \\n\\n-Austin Osman Spare, Anathema of Zos- \\n\\nThe Sermon to the Hypocrites \\n \\nOf all the possibilities in the astral plane,\\n the legendary Witches Sabbat is the most \\nenshadowed. Many descriptions of the Sabba\\nt are based on dreams and sight, more often \\nthe people who give details of the Sabbat are \\nsorcerers who make careful record of the \\nevents. Austin Osman Spare made signifi\\ncant developments concerning this often \\nunderstood and misrepresented magickal a\\nssumption. The Sabbat takes place several times a year depending on the desire and \\nrequires no set communication between the \\nmembers. As I have stated, it is based on the \\nsubconscious desire and ur\\nge to take part in \\nthe Sabbat. \\n \\nPrimarily the Sabbat is based on astral uni\\non and the shedding of restrictive dogma and \\nday side denials which ta\\nke place within each sorcerer\\'s \\nlife unless they live with a harem \\nfar away from civilization. The Sabbat as desc\\nribed in general take\\ns place deep in the \\nforest, when the moon stands full in the night\\n. Witches, both male and female attend with \\ntheir Elemental servitors and imps, who \\n participate in the ceremony, celebrating \\naccording to their masters\\' will while in their astral form. \\n\\n \\nOne god form often presiding over the Sabba\\nth is known as OZ or Baphomet, among \\nother names. This god form often manifests on\\n the astral plane as either: a mental or \\npsychic focus of the group, wherein the form is mutually established so that each thought \\n\\npattern establishes a common link of subc\\nonscious thought between the witches; \\nalternatively the form is assumed naturally by \\na magus who is in atte\\nndance. If more than \\none magickian assumes the form then it w\\nill become fused as one which will hold no \\nidentity beyond the god form they assume. \\n  85 85 The Sabbat is a source of self-recreation \\nand observation of pleasure and self-love. \\nNothing becomes nothing, all sim\\nilarities to the day side aspe\\nct of study is thrown aside. \\nThat side is forgotten in the world of the dr\\neam that is waking - where sorcery dances in \\nembers of witch flame. \\n\\n \\nAn astral musick takes onwards\\n the desire of the Sabbath, k\\nnown as the flute of Pan. The \\ngod form of Pan is always present in essence \\nat the Sabbath, not always as a god form but \\nin essence. The great shadow of Pan (anot\\nher aspect of OZ but as ALL and SHADOW) \\nguards the night and the forests, creator of th\\ne music of the dead. A \\ngreat fire will spring \\nup in a clear place in a fiel\\nd where all have gathered.  \\nThe bonfire will be great and \\nbeautiful, showing glimpses of spectral  faces in\\n its flames. The fire is always a symbol of \\nhidden desire and wisdom from the result. The \\nresult is always an extension of the will  \\nthat derives from subconscious desire. \\n\\nThe dead will gather in some cases and dance around the fire. Elementals are often \\n\\nobserved that have odd and wicked\\nly interesting forms, they t\\noo will dance w\\nith the dead \\nif you are so filled with joy and pleasure. This is the result of Witches Sabbatal union \\n\\nunder the moon in which you will fly.  The Sabbat\\n may be prepared by a personal feast \\nand sexual arousal - without orga\\nsm! Incense should be burnt \\nprofusely in the chamber of \\nsleep and no disturbances shoul\\nd be able to reach you if at \\nall possible. The focus should \\nbe a sigil of the Sabbath. \\n \\nThe Sabbat will generally occur on the seasonal changes, the most frequent and \\n\\nsignificant of these astral congr\\negations is in October before\\n and directly after Samhain \\n(pronounced \\'sow-in\\'). The second most favor\\nable and active is at the Spring Equinox, \\nhowever Sabbats are not necessarily \"dated\" \\nor \"agreed\" upon. It is often a subconscious \\ncall between others to meet in \\nthe shadow lands. It is important to note that the vampiric \\nsorcerer does not attend the Sabbat for pred\\natory purposes. Its purpose is to come unto \\nyour own kind, be they \"vampires\", \"Ghosts\" or\\n what-have-you, a celebration not a battle. Any sexual congress, astral transformation \\nand such which may occur are between the \\nastrals participating. A basis of desire and manifestation will occur in these dreams. \\n The Sabbat  \\nLuciferian- \\n\\nThe Luciferian Sabbat; the union of the spirit \\nwith the Seraphic Ange\\nls and Watchers. By \\nHoly meditation on the brilliance of the illumina\\nted self will the Black Flame or Essence \\nof Self be discovered. This is the ritual of\\n the Holy Guardian Angel Œ The True Will/True \\nSelf. Symbolized by the Luciferian Ascent of the isolated or Sethian (Setian) sense of \\n\\nbeing is self-deification possibl\\ne within a positive aspect. The Angelic Famulus (Latin for \\nFamiliar also the HGA) is the expression and essence of the True Self is a magickally \\n\\ndeveloped form. This is the divine initiator, the inspiration or muse of the self. The \\n\\nAngelic Familiar is the result of Luciferian\\n Self-Liberation, the \\nAngel which fell through \\ndarkness to again emerge in the Light of Bei\\nng. In the Saturnian Gnosis, this Rite and \\nsate of being is the Higher octave of \\nSaturn, from which one may ascend through from \\nthe Darkness or Demonium of the Earth. \\n\\nThe Chant of Going unto the Luciferian Sabbat-   86 86  ﬁBy torch and burning light do I as\\ncend to the highest aethyr. I \\ncall to the Fire Djinn who brought the spark to common clay Œ \\n\\nthat from the green and desert la\\nnds do I rise unto the company of \\nthe spirits of the air, to join in\\n union with those of Cunning Fire Œ \\nSpirits who illuminate in the flame of the sun! I do seek to go \\n\\nforth unto the Angelic Soul Œ Lu\\ncifer Rising through my self Œ \\nEmerald Crowned Bringer of Light. I seek the gates of Heaven \\n\\nand Holy Essence of the Sun, that my spirit may become the \\n\\nessence of flame and creation. \\n\\n \\nI shall go forth unto the Empyrean \\nGathering of the Elphame Œ to \\nstrengthen in the light of Lucet\\n Œ Azazel who brought us to the \\ngates of becoming. I am both shadow and light, I shall go forth in \\n\\ndream and waking fleshﬂ \\n \\nInfernal- \\nThe earthly demonic Sabbat Œ the descent of th\\ne Luciferian Self (spirit) unto the darkness \\nof Set Œ The Peacock cloaked essence of the se\\nrpent. The Infernal Sabbat is the earthly \\ngathering of the shades of the dead, thos\\ne under the watch of Azrail, of Vampyric \\nCongress and lycanthropic transformation. It \\nis the forbidden mysteries of the Kingdom \\nof Shadows, the very gateway of the Aby\\nss, of Anubis. The Infernal Sabbat may be \\nperformed and experienced on two levels si\\nmultaneously; in the spirit and dreaming \\naspect from which the shades of the dead join\\n with the living, as well as in waking as a \\nform of the liberating Black Mass or similar Rite of the Adversary. It is the crossroads of \\n\\nwhich we meet in spirit Œ Infernum Sabbati. \\n The Chant of Going Unto the Infernal Sabbat- \\n\\n ﬁI do seek the flesh of the wolf a\\nnd toad Œ in the Devil™s Skin do I \\ntransform. I summon forth the flesh of the dreaming sabbbat Œ \\n\\nthat I become in the fires of hell. By the Northern Quarter of \\n\\nNight do I summon thee Œ Hecate, by\\n three and turn of the dark \\nmoon, widdershins about the sacred circle Œ by Owl and Bat Great shadows of darkness in light, to go in the company of the \\n\\nshades of the dead.

The 8 \\nŒ pointed Luciferian or Sabbat Star known \\nalso as the Chaos Sphere (Algol), the porta\\nl to Baphomet. The God of Dual Ecstasies, \\nOctinimos/Baphomet is the result of the \\nself-alchemical union of the Fallen Seraph \\n  87 87 Samael and the Queen of the Night, Lilith. \\n The Witches Sabbat Goat is the Gateway \\ntowards the mysteries unspoken, whispered against the Sun in the land of Khem. \\n \\nThe Essence of the 8-Pointed Witches Sa\\nbbat Star Œ The Luciferian Path of \\nTransformative Magick \\n\\n \\n‚The Great Work™ is the Path of Self-Know\\nledge, power and internal development. The \\nVery essence of Magick, to Ascend. The ambi\\nvalent path of High Magick is but the \\ngateway toward High Sorcery, self-rea\\nlization, development and control. \\n \\nThe path or 8 points of the Luciferian Path are as follows maps \\nof self-attainment. \\n \\nONE: By self-purification let the body be cleaned of impurities. Fasting, abstinence and \\n\\nthe disciplines of self-control for a period \\nof time be implemented. By controlling the \\nthoughts and intakes of the body may one later \\nindulge and enjoy the pleasures of the \\nearth. \\nTWO: Control by developing the Will that the Body shall become still. Yoga and similar \\n\\nmethods of obtainment be practiced until the se\\nlf is still in the body. Envision the self in \\npresent and direction or path from which you may become. \\n \\nTHREE: The Binding to the Luciferic Path of \\nthe Adversary, the dedication to the Great \\nWork of Becoming. This may be conducted \\nby ones own initiatory ritual, and ‚The Bornless One Ritual of Ascension™. Conduct th\\nese workings of High Magick until the \\nFlaming Swords of the Seraphim reveal the path\\n of the Emerald Crown of Lucifer, that in \\nHoly Light of the Cunning Fire shall you become in the Illumination of Seth. \\n FOUR: The Earthly journey of the sorcerer, the \\npath of the Adversary \\nand Devil in flesh. \\nThe individual shall move thr\\nough the dual ecstasies to work \\nwith both shadow and light. \\nThis is the development of the Bestial and \\nAngelic Familiar; the Holy Guardian Angel \\nand Evil Genius-Congressus cum Daemone. \\n\\n \\nFIVE: This is the initiation by Magickal retirement for a period, from which one observes \\nSethian Isolation and the various \\naspects of self. The initiate shall receive instructions of \\nthe Coven, and may then seek the discarnate w\\nho reside in the Lands of the Gast for self-\\nintrospection. \\n\\n \\nSIX: The infernal induction. The initiate \\nshall embrace the Daemonic Essence and enjoy \\nthe pleasures of the earth. The initiate shal\\nl for a period chosen by the coven, become an \\navatar for a specific associate God or Goddess form of the Higher \\n\\nFamulus/Angel/Demon. \\n\\n \\nSEVEN: This is the path of over-stimula\\ntion and exhaustion, which ushers forth ones \\nComing into Being. This may be conducted for a period with devotion to the Goddess \\n\\nBabalon/Lilith/AZ. That all sexual and physi\\ncal acts are focused and dedication to ones \\nbecoming through Her. Your Body shall be a Temple in HER name. \\n\\n   88 88 EIGHT: The veil of Anpu and \\nthe Awakening of Seker. The \\nVampyric ReManifestation. \\nThe Dual Ecstasies are intertwined and Baphom\\net emerges as self. The Death Posture, \\nfocus of the Vampyric Mysteries of Khem sh\\nall then the Luciferian Awakening come to \\npass. \\n \\nThe 8-Pointed Path of Luciferian and Infe\\nrnal Becoming be undertaken through a period \\nof 12 months. Keep a journa\\nl of both dreams and workings\\n to monitor your results. \\n The Infernal Luciferian Path- \\n \\nONE: Path of Infernal Congress: \\nGoetic and ﬁLowﬂ Sorcery brought in union \\nwith High Sorcery. Summoning and binding \\natavistic and earth bound forces, substance from\\n shadow. The initiate\\n will visualize each \\naspect of the Daemon/Spirit as a path of self. \\n\\n \\nTWO: Path of Shaitan the Adversary: \\n\\nThis is the self-invoked transformation of the \\nDevil of the Earth Œ the Fire Djinn-Seraph \\nIblis/Azazel who brought the Black Flame unto humanity. Shaitan is the path of \\n\\nLuciferian self-liberation from which we gr\\now and expand consciousness, from this path \\nwe develop in the darkness and shadow of self. \\n \\nTHREE: Path of Lycanthropic Transformation \\n\\n \\n-Meditation unto the transformative state of th\\ne Werewolf. Perform a ritual of the Devil™s \\nSkin. The ritual will \\nproject into dreams the state of \\nthe Beast. Meditate, imagine and \\nvisualize the stages \\nof transformation before dreaming. Keep a detailed Journal of \\nvisions, desires thoughts and difference be\\ntween this lycanthropic state and normal \\nwaking. \\n \\nFOUR: Path of Nocturnal Flight \\n\\n \\n-The individual will meditate on transforma\\ntion in the astral and dreaming form as a \\nbat/raven/bird or such. Keep a detailed \\nrecord of the imagined and visualized \\ntransformation in reference of \\nmemory, all feelings and stra\\nnge ideals which are brought \\nforth. Once this is mastered with tangible re\\nsults to the initiate, \\nyou may at this time \\nbegin to shape shift into a combination of an\\nimals and birds, which \\nattribute suits your personality and desire. \\n \\nFIVE: Path of the Serpent: \\n\\n \\nThe primal awakening and entry into Leviat\\nhan, the serpentine aspect of the psyche. \\nThinking in this path tends to reflect co\\nld and logical thinki\\nng patterns, devoid of \\nemotion. While this may at firs\\nt be contrary to your\\n own personality, keep a focus of this \\npath as you will eventually balance out aspects considered cold in forms of thinking \\n\\nbefore action, ect. The point of this path is\\n to initiate self-study and thinking before \\nimpulsive action. The serpent is wisdom and stealth. \\n  89 89  SIX: Path of the Infernal Dragon: \\n \\nThe primal essence of Flame and Water shall be\\n united; the Dragon shal\\nl then take flesh. \\nThe initiate shall utilize his or her magickal\\n and sorcerous techniques to expand their own knowledge and span of control. \\nThe seeker shall also visualiz\\ne nightly a great Dragon, as \\na form of their own self and then seek en\\ntry through the coils of Leviathan = Timeless \\nEssence. It is at this point timeless consci\\nousness, the goal being Immortality of the \\nPsyche shall be explored in depth. \\n \\nSEVEN: Path of Ahriman \\n\\n \\nThe Lord of Darkness and Shadows, the Vam\\npyric Essence itself. The initiate works in \\nmeditation upon developing the shadow into va\\nrious forms of transformation, via creating \\nngangas and fetishes. This is the essence \\nof the multitude of D\\naemonic Transformation. \\nKeep a detailed journal on the results therei\\nn, including the paths of Goetic and medieval \\ngrimoire workings which involve summoning thes\\ne interior and exterior\\n forces as a form \\nof yourself, that you may absorb and become as\\n them, they as yourself. It is during this \\nSelf-Transformative work that the realization of ﬁIﬂ as either a multitude of forms comes \\n\\ninto being, that you may strengthen and beco\\nme a solid form of being, controlled and \\nable in your own self-directed journey of initiation. \\n\\n \\nEIGHT: Path of Azrail (Azrael): \\n\\n \\nThe death (Vampyric) of self will be enacted in\\n a Tibetan inspired ‚Chud™ Ritual, calling \\nof the ancestral dead and shad\\nes to feast upon the body. This is\\n a form of sacrifice from \\nwhich the manes of the dead feed from the \\nliving body, to give these forms substance and \\nevolutionary ‚sparks™ which may benefit the sorcerer later. The spirit of the initiate is also \\n\\ninfused with the ancestral or chthonic shade which is a form of\\n self-initiation. The Path of Azrail also explores the phantasms and ghost \\ndoors in Ritual Sorcery, from which one \\nmay commune with the shades \\nof the dead. The initiate will also meditation upon his own \\ndeath, the path which leads to Vampyric Awakening. \\n\\n \\n \\nCalling of the 8 Points of Baphomet, being th\\ne secret essence of \\nSamael and Lilith \\nrevealed! \\n\\nIt is Baphomet who is essence of the Circle\\n, the God of the Eightfold Power associated \\nwith an earth based summoni\\nng. This is a manifestation of Baphomet and a form of \\nNylarlathotep, the Black Shadow of the Sabbat. \\n\\n \\nThe Sabbat is one of resurgen\\nt desire and awakening. Go \\nforth with freedom, joy and \\npleasure! A description of one such event follows. Within the dream a\\nll is possible and all becomes. \\n\\n\"I remember preparing myself  for the \\nevening, incense burning \\nthickly on this mid \\nOctober evening. I had spent most of the day looking forward to this eve and now it had \\n\\ncome. I knew, as an initiate who would go forth by night, that much significance would \\n  90 90 manifest in the dream realm. Sleep was co\\nming, as welcome as a mid-evening lover. I \\nhad been focusing on a vision of Black Eagl\\ne, through a sigil base\\nd on the concept.  \\nNight rose with a passion unmatched by even the most lustful embrace. \\n\\n \\nAs I closed my eyes, focusing upon the Varc\\nolaci Sigil, I felt a \\npower within my body \\nrising; it was like a collection of energy that could make \\nyour body burst with excitement, \\nif by chance you were in such a situation. As\\n I was also very relaxed it was entirely a \\nsurreal feeling, devoid of physical stress or \\nurge. Each limb was qui\\nte relaxed and limp. I \\nfelt as if I was flowing towards a different \\nand most welcoming world.  The form I was \\ntaking was of the dual aspect of\\n shadow and beast, my color \\nwas black as it was attuned \\nwith my true nature. Not evil or necessarily \\nsinister but based firmly in the nightside \\nrealm. Sunlight was mine in the morning, this evening I was reaching towards a shadow \\n\\ngod! \\nI felt my body rising, not my physical body mind \\nyou, but a great astral form which I can \\nchange at will. I felt my form becoming that \\nof a bat, I could float now in this chamber. \\nOpening an astral eye I could understand through sight what I had become, what beauty it \\nwas to view the self from a seemingly extern\\nal eye. I decided to go forth into the great \\nnight, to that which awaited me. \\n\\nThe Varcolaci Sigil was still burning in my\\n mind, a collage of black and blood red. \\nReminiscent of the Scarlet Woman who had ma\\nnifested some time before and vanished. I \\nknew what was out there, at the same time\\n not knowing what awaited me. It was that \\npleasure and excitement which called to my very essence. \\n\\nThe wind was gusty and chilly that evening. It was not unpleasantly cold, just the kind of \\n\\nweather where you would normally need a light j\\nacket or such. Astral form tends to not \\nlay restrictions of clothes upon one unless it \\nis their own will. I had grown to understand \\nthe purpose and being of Choronzon, being th\\ne point at which madness and nothingness \\ncould manifest. Choronzon is only demonic be\\ncause it exists between\\n dusk and dawn, it \\nis between universe \"A\" and \"B\", a guardian\\n if you will. I had invoked this energy before \\nand found it quite beneficial in\\n the avenues of mental strengt\\nh, it also challe\\nnged all that \\nwas - wishing to devour it. I had fought it\\n before, nearly going \\ninto Choronzon, being \\nsaved only by the last threads of WILL wh\\nich, ultimately proved those threads were \\nactually ropes! I took to flying in the ni\\nght, letting my direction be guided by an \\nElemental I called TZBA, a form which was created for night travels for a period of time. \\n\\nI knew the Sabbat would draw me to it, I \\nyearned for the communi\\non which would offer \\nabundant pleasure. \\nMy astral form kept strong in the wind, t\\nhough I was observing all around me in a frantic \\npace of already dawning ecstasy and burge\\noning excitement. I knew through will and \\ncontrol that I could remain in this state for \\nsome time. I recollect how I mastered this act \\nof dream control, having  understood the im\\nportance of remaining focused on other semi-\\npsychonautic levels. Through Karezza and Tibe\\ntian Tantric breathing \\ncontrol exercises I \\nhad developed the strength for astral travel. It \\nis true that some have a \"knack\" for it, for \\nothers it is a discipline. For \\nmyself, it was a bit of both. I recall the first time I entered the \\nastral plane, it was amazing and so short \\nbecause through panic and excitement I was \\ndrawn back into my physical body. This was however quite natural and even more \\n\\nobstacles came in my path the first time I attempted the Death Posture. \\n  91 91 I continued to remain in nocturn\\nal flight, my astral wings dr\\new me further into a wooded \\narea. Much fog lay across the landscape and th\\ne sight was beautiful. I knew that in the \\nnight I was free and, even though on the as\\ntral plane there are often wars among \\nsorcerers, that I was safe unto myself. I ha\\nd, after all, developed strength and protective \\nwalls from the blood and sexual fluids of tw\\no individuals from many nights of Tantric \\nElemental formations. \\n\\nI began to hear disembodied chants, in ma\\nny different voices and \\ntones, often sounding \\nboth angelic and demonic. I saw within the \\nforest a vast cleari\\nng. A huge bonfire lit up \\nthe area, and various torche\\ns surrounded the area, beyond which were great shadows of \\nnight. A numerous assembly of witches ha\\nd come, many in human form. Their astral \\nshapes were either beautiful or grotesque, so\\nme demonic and animal like. I felt a charge \\nof happiness and astounding energy. Some \\nlooked upon my form, which by my will I \\ncould alter to become more wolf-human like. \\nI felt the greetings from these beings, like a \\nfamily that I had always known but had neve\\nr found. It was like findi\\nng a long lost friend \\nwho, with many tears and struggles, you had finally found. In front of the bonfire, with flames showing \\nthe faces of the dead, stood what was known \\nto me as the Witches Sabbat Goat - the G\\nod of Witches. This beast stood with arms \\nfolded, you could feel a strong sense of strengt\\nh and beauty within its essence. I was not \\nsure if it was a god form taken by another cele\\nbrant or a collection of astral forms and \\nenergies into this great being. The Devil wa\\ns a sigil of our desi\\nre however and not a \\nsymbol of anthropomorphic worship or death-lust\\n as Christians often view this form. The \\nMorning Star nestled between his horns, and it\\ns eyes were a burning re\\nd. I could feel no \\nevil that night, however for the uninitiated I \\nknew there could be much danger, since they \\ncould not control or understand themse\\nlves. Even though we were celebrating, \\nChoronzon always is waiting to devour. \\nMany of the witches and demonic shapes bega\\nn joining hands and circling the bonfire. I \\nheard the flutes of Pan echoing around us. Dr\\nums, repetitive and steady, sounded fast \\naround us as well. The musick and energy hurle\\nd us all into a lycanthropic frenzy. Each \\nof us began celebrating in our own individua\\nl ways, some in sexu\\nal congress, some by \\ndancing, many floating in the sky with a moon \\nright above us. I had \\nalways wanted to \\nknow why the moon on the Witches Sabbat gath\\nering was always above us, though in \\nany other astral travels it was \\nalways BELOW us. I feel at th\\nis time, when the Sabbath is \\ncalled we are still in the earth dimension, though\\n in a remote location and in astral form. \\nThe sounds are so clear yet sti\\nll muffled at the same time. I could hear wolves and such, \\nprowling around the fires and among the other w\\nitches. We were drawing power from the \\nmoon, I was chanting a mantra redolent with re\\nsurgence and joy. I felt so alive and free. I \\ncould feel the beast which was my form. I knew that which was ours for the taking. \\n\\nExistence is pure joy indeed. \\nThe female witches were indeed, as described \\nby Spare, taking quite the active role. They \\nseemed to almost dominate the Sabbat\\nh, to which I took no \\noffense and found it beautiful. The witches, no matter how beautif\\nul or ugly, were joyous and filled with a \\nburning passion. You could see and feel the Fi\\nre-Snake energy rise from them at some \\npoints. It was now time for the \\nincantations to begin. During \\nthe entirety of the Sabbath \\nmany shapes slithered about, giving a surreal \\natmosphere to an already amazing event. \\nThe Sabbath was then conducted with further \\ncongress and lust, for the astral form can \\nprove extremely stimulating on physical leve\\nls. Activity is based on the uninterrupted \\n  92 92 coagulation of lunar energy, mainly manife\\nsted through the female. Through this male \\nenergy may be harnessed and redirected into\\n the inherent dream, which the Witches\\' \\nSabbat is based upon. Much blood flows, an im\\nage of the menstrual cycle of the witch, \\ntranslated into the form of the Scarlet Woman. The Sabbath  concludes with a spiral of \\n\\nwhirlwind activity and then awakening in the physical body. The participant generally \\n\\nfeels much stronger and revitalized. \\n\\n Nachtfahr - Astral Gatherings \\n Of wooded dreams so gathered \\nwith moss, and a silent watc\\nher clothed in the ebony of \\ntwilight past. As the mist drapes our fragile \\nsight a new form approaches, from which all \\nis distilled, forming into a new vision. A night \\nsky above, dark as the wings of an eagle of shadow, letting cascades of \\nblood: it calls to us at cr\\nossroads lost, with bounded \\nknowledge of seasons to be! \\n \\nThe dream is the backwards gateway to the Witches\\' Sabbat, wherein desire is formed \\n\\ninto flesh. Belief exists on the consistency \\nof experience. The following formula for the \\ninitiation of the Astral Sabbath is derived \\nfrom AO Spare and his experiences with Ms. \\nPaterson, who was descended from a line of Sa\\nlem Witches. From the methods of ZOS, \\nNon-Gardnerian and Gardnerian\\n English craft (14)\\n, as well as our own experience and \\nwork with this lineal stream, comes this ne\\nw \"old\" system of witc\\nhcraft and sorcery. \\nBefore one attempts this initiation, a creativ\\ne and spiritual flow must encompass every \\naspect of your being. A sigil should be cons\\ntructed which constitutes a dedication to the \\nCraft and the Path of the Wise. \\n\\nThe astral departure of the spirit and body w\\nithin the Witches Sabbat \\nCraft is symbolised \\nby the shedding of the serpents skin, of la\\nying waste to the old \\nin the reaching of \\nsomething new. It can be viewed as a psyc\\nhic rebirth wherein a heavy weight is taken \\nfrom ones shoulders. The astral conclave is\\n exceedingly haunting for those on uninitiated \\npaths who, in dream, are drawn to such a ga\\nthering. We might susp\\nect many tales of the \\nSabbath have come down to us this way.  So\\nme questions may arise, such as, \"Is the \\nWitches Sabbat Craft and Vampiric Sorcery base\\nd only in dream?\"  The answer is no, it \\nis not, sorcery and witchcraft have their basi\\ns in time drawn secrets which are transferred \\nthrough the dreaming state. The root of unde\\nrstanding the whole basis of magickal \\nchange is in delving into the great dark subc\\nonscious itself. The s\\nubconscious is linked, \\nas a partial gateway, to th\\ne Abyss and its guar\\ndian Choronzon. Each individual is a \\ncarrier of the current. There are doors, linki\\nng us to the great effigy of magickal power, \\nwithin every person who is called by their lineal descent of witch blood. This single door embraces the many symbols, be \\nthey pentacle or chaos sphere, the aim is \\nprimarily the same - to explore and make \\nuse of the mind. To control the universe \\nrelevant to his or her manufactured reality. \\n\\nI have found that varied techniques, em\\nployed by various minds, embody a single key \\nand have but one significance.\\n Through them it is possible fo\\nr the inspired individual to \\nmanipulate and control the way he or she desi\\nres. The essence of the True Will or Holy \\nGuardian Angel is the freedom, desire and st\\nrength to explore thei\\nr entire universe of \\nbeing, from the sun filled peaks \\nof ancient towers to the catacombs of ghastly atavisms. \\nAll is possible to a mind of awakened light! \\n  93 93 The teachings of old are of interest to the student and the adept for the method of \\ninspiration. The various methods which can be \\ndeveloped from the old generally result in \\nrebirth to the lineage. It is up to the indi\\nvidual to explore and \\nrewrite many of these \\nmethods. It is not that the old \\nways should be destroyed, rath\\ner they should generally be \\nreworked to suit the sorcerer performing such methods. \\n\\nMagick and Witchcraft are but a mirror and tool\\n of the Will, to know this is to become \\nbeyond it! It is recommended that\\n the aspiring sorcerer-in\\nitiate to the Witches Sabbat \\nMysteries enjoy a considerable familiarity w\\nith another of the blood. The initiate should \\ntake care however, to choose their contact wisely, many will prove useless or dangerous. \\n\\nA basic sigil should be drawn out, such would be a sentence as \" I DESIRE TO ATTEND \\nTHE WITCHES SABBATH\".  Random lett\\ners should then be crossed out: \\n\\'IDRETTDBTH\\' and the rearranged: \\'IDTTRDB\\nTHE\\' until the sentence forms a working \\nsymbol. The sigil should then\\n be consecrated via sexual fl\\nuid or your own blood. It \\nshould be placed in a pouch with herbs or ot\\nher small objects which hold significance to \\nthe sorcerer. An invocation with the Witche\\ns\\' Rune should be performed and the pouch \\nkept close to the body of the \\nindividual for several days. On\\nce the sigil is memorized and \\nconsecrated ritualistically, it \\nmay be placed upon the altar. \\nLegends also tell of Witches smearing their bod\\nies in some obscure ointment in order to \\nobtain flight across the sky. One workable \\nexplanation of such \\ntales is the Witch \\nobtaining flight in dream facilitated by an oi\\nntment, which would contain such fluids as \\nblood or sexual excretion, mixed \\nwith herbs, oils and ashes. \\nOnce the ointment is created, \\na small amount should be spread over th\\ne forehead, chest or breast of the witch. The ointments used by medieval witches we\\nre combinations of such extremely potent \\nherbs as Mandrake, Deadly Nightshade, He\\nnbane, and Hemlock. These herbs would be \\nmixed in a base of lard and be smeared\\n upon the body.  The intention should then be \\nbound into the ointment, by focused concentrat\\nion, before taking to\\n the night sky in \\ndream. The webs of belief are always formed \\nout of inspiration, a flash of consistent \\ndesire which in turns recovers\\n in the incarnation of lust. \\n \\n Astral Sabbat Initiation  \\nThe initiation into the Witches Sabbat mysteries are the primary focus of the symbol of \\n\\nall magick, that of a hidden \\nor shadowed nature. To rev\\neal and understand is the very \\nessence of what humans are and what their \\nvaried individual goa\\nls are. Study now and \\npractice more. The astral Sabbat is a calling to\\nwards the dreaming self, that of which will \\nbe opened unto the gates of the Watcher, all thin\\ngs are of basis in the astral and take flesh \\nthrough the will itself. Once one enters the gate\\ns of the Watcher then can none return, as \\nyou will become something more, maybe awaken\\ning shall frighten those not of the blood \\nand perhaps it shall startle even\\n those who are dedicated.

To unveil \\nthis is to \\nknow the very \\nessence of what humans are, and what their \\nvaried individual goa\\nls are. Study now and \\npractice more. The astral Sabbat ever calls to \\nthe dreaming self,  with its dark promise to \\nopen the gates of the Watcher. \\n All things have their basis \\nin the astral and take flesh \\nthrough the will itself. Once one enters the gate\\ns of the Watcher then can none return, as \\nyou will become something more.

After all the roots of all \\nignorant belief and faith are pl\\nanted in the comfortable area \\nin which we feel \\'at home\\'; \\nawakening from such delusions of stability can be supremely uncomfortable. \\n\\n \\nThe altar should be adorned with an imag\\ne or representation of HECATE, LUCIFER, \\nASMODEUS and LILITH (15).

AMEN. \\n \\n Spirit Servitors and Guardians  \\nSpirit servitors are extremely useful for th\\ne vampire who practices astral projection \\nfrequently, as you are often \\nleaving the human body open fo\\nr attack. The \"Black Iron \\nWalls\" are quite powerful however it is more id\\neal to create servitors based on sigils to \\nguard the chamber in which you sleep. The reason for this is simple, once your astral \\n\\ndouble has left the human body, the will is not \\nnecessarily in perfect tune with the \\ndefense settings you have created. In other wo\\nrds, although Elementa\\nls are also born of \\ndesire and will, they can be charged with \\na specific purpose. The Iron Walls act only as a \\nblocking force for unwanted spiritual energy which appears negative towards the will and \\npsyche. Its primary role is to protect agai\\nnst another taking control of your physical body, \\nif such occurs it is possible for possession\\n and split personalitie\\ns to take place. An \\nElemental form composed of will, blood, sexual fluid and visualization can offer a \\n\\npower-packed method of protection ag\\nainst this and other hazards. Such Elementals may be created or summoned \\nby the consecration of sigils. The creation \\nof such sigils involves the combination of\\n various symbols representing the desired \\npowers of the Elemental. Once combined and co\\nnsecrated the sorcerer is able, with blood \\nor sexual fluid, to endow a \\nform of life upon the Elemental \\non the astral plane. The \\nguardian should be given direct \\ninstructions at the creation, \\nand all belief focused on this purpose. Nothing should be said to the Elementa\\nl after this because th\\ney consist of pure \\nwill. Once you feel the purpose of the imp is served, the Elemental may be banished and \\n\\nthe sigil destroyed after a concentration phase of reabsorbing the Elemental. \\nElementals are sometimes employed by the so\\nrcerer in the activities of the Witches \\nSabbat. Therein magickians and sorcerers ente\\nr the astral plane for congress and union, \\ncelebration and a mutual harnessing of i\\nndividual power. This goes well beyond all \\ndogmatic forms since the true nature is often revealed in the dream, there is no restriction \\n\\nbeyond will. \\n\\n The Evocation of Familiars  \\nThe many capabilities of the Zos Kia Cultus (16) and sorcery are opened  by the \\'key\\' of \\n\\nthe Zos and the Kia; symbolically the \\'all t\\nouching hand\\' (representing manifestation) and \\nthe Eye or Vulva (the all seeing eye) through \\nwhich the ID takes flesh. Within European \\nfolklore are tales of witches having numerous familiars, ranging through all the many \\n\\nbeings of the forest: the Cat, Bat, Owl, \\nRaven, Rabbit and so on. The significance of each \\ncreature is known among \\nthose of the witch-blood. The witch would make an evocation to bring fo\\nrth an Elemental, in response to which the \\ndevil would grant her the wish. The symbolism \\nof the devil is the c\\nonnection with nature \\nwhich the sorcerer would have developed \\nthrough the Witches Sabbat Craft. What the \\ndevil represents is the sigil of desire, the \\npoint of reality made flesh. The witch would \\noften make numerous evocations to enflesh the \\nfamiliar of his/her choice, be it cat or owl \\n  96 96 or other and issue a single purpose for which the ID was to work. Such familiars might \\ntake flesh in a dreaming spirit manifestati\\non. Alternatively an actua\\nl living animal would \\nappear and take a liking to the witch several weeks after the \\nevocation was made. \\n \\nIn modern times rural towns are being abso\\nrbed by large, populated cities, or being \\nabandoned. The forests are shrinking, or crashing down altogeth\\ner. In this cyber age the \\nwitch must advance with the times while holdi\\nng on to traditions and inspirational points \\nof living. In other words they must do what is\\n suited to their individual needs and desires \\nin the new situation. Familiars can be deliver\\ners of messages upon the astral plane, if not \\nactually incarnate in a living animal. The fa\\nmiliar sigil should be focused upon before \\nsleep, the sigillised intention should be quite\\n simple, expressed in a short phrase. Once \\nthis is memorized you focus on the individual to \\nwhom it is to travel. It is very likely \\nsomeone you are in contact with \\nalready in one way or another.  \\nElementals in the form of animals can be usef\\nul as either atavisms or Ids, being desires \\nmanifested in a mental and archetypal form. \\nOne particular method is as follows: Procure \\na sigil which represents the form you want th\\ne familiar to take. The sigil should represent \\nwhat you are evoking.  A small amount of sexua\\nl fluid could be used to charge the \\nElemental, if it is of a vampiric nature th\\nen you will want to cons\\necrate it with blood and \\nsexual fluid. It is possible on \\nthe waking or day side level \\nto create an Elemental from \\nparts of different animals. Examples include\\n a bat winged wolf or\\n a fierce and rabid dog \\nwith wings and hooves, even a sea based cr\\neature spawned from the depths of your \\nimagination. Such could be formed into a sigil and made to perform one particular \\n\\nbidding, and the form manifested\\n clearly upon the astral plane. Austin Spare was said to \\nhold a significant power, learned from Yelg Paterson his witc\\nh mother, of the creation of \\nexactly such spirits. \\n In dreams one could appear to others as having\\n several spirits in the forms of animals or \\ndemonic beasts swirling around hi\\nm/her; either to attack or \\nthreaten a rival or enemy, or \\nto make a calling to a friend or lover. \\n\\nOnce the spirit has achieved its goal, or your goa\\nl to be precise, it is wise to destroy the \\nsigil and absorb the Elemental so that it re\\nturns to the dark matter of the brain. The \\nessence would be reassimilated into your s\\nubconscious, until formed into a new shape \\naccording to your desires. \\n\\n \\n The Sabbat or the Ascension of Dream  \\nA recent experience of mine at the Sabbat was \\none of exhilaration and ecstasy. While my \\nattending of the dream conclave contained \\nno sexual contact with \\nany other spirit I did witness much, and mentally experience th\\nat which created si\\nmilar effects on my \\ndreaming mind. \\n\\n \\nIt was the Spring Equinox of 1999, which I ha\\nd planned to attend for several weeks. I \\nkept an exact journal of th\\ne methods of training which enabled me to retain a sharp \\nmemory of the experience. I had induced tran\\nce via mental ecstasy for several nights, \\n  97 97 using different techniques in\\ncluding Pratayama, Asana and \\nother methods including the \\nDeath Posture. I felt as though I was quite r\\neady, never using mind altering drugs for any \\nof the trance induction. \\nI had performed the Day Side Sabbat (17) as\\n a ceremonial, with two friends, though I did \\nnot see them attend the astral rite later that \\nevening. After the rite we sat about and talked \\nfor a little over an hour. Upon their departure, with great excitement, I took to further \\n\\npreparing my bed chamber (where my pers\\nonal altar was located at the time) and \\nadorning it with statues of Ka\\nli, Hecate, Lilith, Pan and  pr\\nints of Austin Spare\\'s witch \\ndrawings. \\nOne particular painting - a reprint which I had paced centrally on the wall, hanging above \\n\\nthe altar, was the Four Flying Witches piec\\ne. This depicts thr\\nee witches upon the ground in some astral state with one\\n flying above. Quite a beautifu\\nl piece which still captivates me to this day.  \\n\\nI had an incense of the four elements which \\nrepresented the forces of transition by which \\nto obtain the communion of witch blood. Candles\\n of black, red, blue and purple adorned \\nthe chamber which  illuminated it with a certain \\nbeauty which felt so rare that evening. It \\nwas my intention to attend in the form of th\\ne Owl, and had created a sigil to assume the \\nform of this particular Id. I had felt the cal\\nlings three nights before this Sabbat Eve. Now \\nI felt my body and form shape shift, into \\na dark shadow and circle the chamber until \\nfalling back into my body. \\n\\nI took a long and relaxing bath and then made the primary invocations using Spare\\'s \\n\\nWitches Sabbat text, which is in the same tr\\nadition as this Grimoire. I completed each \\ninvocation until I retired to bed. I used a fo\\ncus technique upon the Four Flying Witches \\npainting until I felt my body growing light\\n. The moon light shined upon my burgundy \\nbed clothes, and the night wind flew lightly ov\\ner the entire chamber. I lost my waking \\nconscious around this time. My memory served\\n me aptly that evening, permitting me to \\ngive a full description here as follows re-written from my journal. \\nThe fog which was surrounding me on awakening \\nwas beautiful yet cold, I felt so cold. In this sharp and crisp night air one could feel\\n the coming of warmer weather. From it my \\nspirit gained a sense of ecsta\\nsy upon which I  rode the ni\\nght sky, in a seeming panic, \\ntowards the Sabbat. When one seeks the Sabbat\\n on the astral plane, \\nit is all too easy to \\nfind. Some sense tends to lead you in the di\\nrection you seek, a guide of sorts. I have \\nheard of some witches creating numerous Id familiars to guide them and attend the \\n\\nconclave. I was seeking ever so intensely to arrive, taking the form of a night owl, and the \\nnight sounds around me as I flew we\\nre filled with exhilaration. I could hear the sounds of moaning and laughi\\nng in the night winds, my mind telling me \\nit was the many witches, beasts, wolves and va\\nmpires of the dream plane. My level of \\nexcitement rose further upon being drawn to\\n these haunting voices. I let out a call \\nsounding so very loud within my ears that it \\nmust have been heard by the ecstatic witches \\nand warlocks. I was joining those of the bl\\nood, those of my lineage, who continue the \\ngreat work of the Witches Sabbat path on th\\nis plane of existence. I could only wonder \\nlater who are the many companions with whom \\nwe frolic with in these states, are they \\ndistant coven members, some gifted one\\n whom I hold correspondence with? A very \\ninteresting point made by a fellow witch one\\n evening, \"We are always of night and yet \\nwe are of the Watcher even more...™ this w\\nould imply that the Watcher/Rehctaw is the \\nreverse and forward method of obtaining hi\\ndden knowledge of the astral plane, the \\n  98 98 language of the subconscious. This was th\\ne most significant point of sorcery, the \\ndiscovery of something more, something hidde\\nn which has always been before my face. \\nWe are of the silent watcher. Know this and let this be understood by those of the blood. I felt my shape moving towards the conclave, an opening in the forest. In this clearing I \\n\\nbeheld within the circle, the Black One, the \\nGoat headed figure which was present at each \\nSabbat I have attended. Always \\nit is slightly different in\\n its appearance: robed, with \\nburning crimson eyes, similar to many woodcar\\nvings and paintings. I felt no fear as I \\napproached, only a growing and yearning desire to be at one with my ilk. One major \\ndifference at this conclave, I noticed the witches were literally hags, dancing with each \\n\\nother surrounded by bestial shapes and their familiars. Some of the familiars were of \\n\\nstrange shapes, wolf heads upon goats and bl\\nack and blood red cats, dancing about in a \\nfrenzied manner. \\n\\nI noticed the flutes of Pan playing their haun\\nting musick close within\\n my ear, a rhythm \\nfilled pulse reverberating within every single spirit in attendance. We were at one. The \\n\\nwomen were wrinkled and mostly naked, thei\\nr shapes writhed thr\\nough the very fires \\nwhich burned at different spots within the field, I could feel their ecstasy as I looked on in awe and astonishment. Even though I had atte\\nnded a Sabbat before, the feeling which one draws from it is something I cannot fully expres\\ns. Each experience is as new as the first \\ntime. \\n\\nVarious spirits would take shape within the \\nfire, floating in and out\\n, melting into each \\ncontour of the fire itself. With every glance at\\n the fire I could see a myriad of faces and \\nshapes forming. The ground was mist covere\\nd, congealing into further shapes which \\nwould then dissipate. \\nThe Black One stood within the center of the gathering, while others floated and danced. \\n\\nEcstasy was writhing within each being, visi\\nble as a yellowish hue surrounding each \\nwitch present. The Goat headed one, surr\\nounded by a red aura, holding both hands aloft \\nwhile two different colored flames danced from it\\'s shapeless claws. One flame was \\ngreen and the other blue. The drums which I \\nheard from the depths of my mind grew \\npounding and loud, combined with the flutes \\nof Pan which danced and entered each \\nglorious note of this primal musick. \\n\\nI lost sight of the Sabbat after my last view \\nof the hags which danced in the passion of the night. I awoke refreshed and very happy to a \\nbeautiful morning, and immediately took to \\nwriting the account from which this descrip\\ntion is drawn. This is one of the more \\nsignificant Sabbaths that I have\\n attended. This lineal inheritance of the witch cult is to \\ngrow once again, and flourish as in many ages\\n since the beginning of the human race. We \\nknow within ourselves the doctr\\nine which we cannot write in\\n words. I am trying to \\ncapture the essence as much as I can, a gate\\nway to this experience, embodied in  the \\nGrimoire now in your hands . \\n\\n Sabbat Invocation  ﬁSamael, Serpent of the Elder Powe\\nrs, Great father of Cain and \\ndweller upon the Earth: I seek kno\\nwledge that my desire shall \\nbring to birth Elementals of fire and water.

SO MOTE IT BEﬂ \\n Zos Kia and the Sorceries of Asmodeus \\n Defined by Austin Spare,\\n ﬁSorcery is a deliberate act of causing \\nmetamorphoses by the employment of Elementals. It forges a link \\n\\nwith the powers of middl\\ne nature (the astral \\nplane) or the ether, \\nthe astrals of great trees and of \\nanimals of every kind. Will is our \\nmedium, belief is our vehicle, and desire is the force combining \\n\\nwith the Elemental. Cryptograms are our talismans and \\n\\nprotectors.\" \\n Art is often considered a mirror of the soul\\n, a reflection of the inner planes of the \\nsubconscious. From art comes compassion, ange\\nr, love, hate, happine\\nss and passion. The \\ninherent dream becomes flesh through sym\\nbols denuded of conscious meaning - leaving \\ninspiration to flash, as a lightning strike of realization, to the heart of the master. \\nAustin Osman Spare\\'s magickal weapon was ar\\nt, a manifestation of a continual Sabbath \\nand the recurring flow of witc\\nh blood, a dance of spirits whic\\nh offered a spiral staircase \\nto another dimension. A detailed tradition, \\nthe Witches Sabbat mystery which Yelg \\nPaterson, Spare\\'s initiator a\\nnd witch mother passed on to a young AOS. Descended from \\n  100 100 a line of Salem Witches, Yelg Paterson \\ncarried enormous indi\\nvidual power through \\nwhich, according to AOS, she could project images into a dark corner while the \\n\\nastonished observers would stare intently. \\nThe sorceries woven by Yelg and eventually \\nAOS would incarnate in the ar\\nt and writings of Spare. This\\n would provide a window for \\nthis current to manifest. \\n\\nTo understand the system of Zos Kia in its ment\\nal expression, one must refer to his art. \\nHis writings give only a secondary view of\\n the magickal worlds. The Sabbat can be \\nobtained through his paintings and drawings, \\neach line causing a psychonautic strain to \\nemerge and lift the individual towards the great \\nand infinite Id of power. The same can be \\nsaid of other artists as well, such as Steffi\\n Grant, Linda Falorio, Rosaleen Norton, Elda \\nIsela Ford and many others. \\n\\nThe key symbols of the Zos Kia Cultus are th\\ne Hand and the Eye. Both are the reifying \\nsymbols of desire made flesh. The means of tr\\nanslation from atavistic urges, the will to \\nflesh and the strength to attain all within\\n possible reach. The hand is the flesh, the \\nstrength to make manifest what the eye believ\\nes and desires. The hand is the force of will \\nand the strength of focus. The hand is all touc\\nhing, respectful to the \\nwill and the self as \\nform and entity.  Kia is the formless essence of\\n all, the heart of Besz in no form. Kia is \\nthe eye or vulva which is the basis for Will, Desire and Belief. To focus ones energy \\n\\nwithin Kia and utilize the interplay of Will, \\nDesire and Belief is to make the enfleshing \\nunion of Zos and Kia. Zos (The Hand) is the \\nstrength and maker of \\nthat which Kia (the \\nEye) sees and wishes to be. The unity of the hand and the eye represents the all seeing \\n\\neye, vision and the hand which makes flesh. \\n\\n \\n\"I Believe What I Will and Will What I Believe\"-AOS \\n\\n \\nThe system of the Zos Kia Cultus as first \\ndescribed by Austin Sp\\nare is at all points \\nassociated or enfleshed with the essence of\\n the Egyptian God Besz\\n, the ever changing, \\never transforming one. The Zos Kia Cultus di\\nffers from other systems which manifest \\nthemselves through dogmatic doctrine. For exam\\nple Thelemic Magick, which is based on \\nthe maxim \"Do what thou wilt shall be the whol\\ne of the Law.\" and \"Love is the law, love \\nunder will\". Such systems are \\nmost significant in their W\\nill training te\\nchniques through ceremonial magick and the art of ritual. \\nThelema is highly recommended for those \\nseeking to discover the Self \\nin its many base forms and to\\n grow from that, building a \\nsolid foundation based on Will, Strength, Joy \\nand the thirst for knowledge. The Zos Kia \\nCultus opens a system of self development a\\nnd the explorations of sorcery by means of \\nself motivation. \\n\\nThe similarities between Zos Kia and Thelema \\nreside in the act of Sex Magick. While \\nThelema uses sex and the act of orgasm as\\n outward directed energy, through which God \\nForms are assumed or the Will is aligned with the purpose, for a result based on \\n\\nknowledge and insight. The Zos Kia Cultus is\\n inward based, using sex and orgasm to \\nexplore the recesses of the self and the control of the Elementals both based in the \\n\\nsubconscious and beyond. This is Sorcery itself\\n, the manifestation of primal gnosis for \\nthe rectification of the atavis\\ntic automata of the self in \\nits many forms. To understand the \\nZos Kia Cultus, one must be familiar with control methods of ceremonial and hermetic \\n\\nmagick, the balanced and light based as\\npects of study. This is why Thelema is \\nrecommended. Before entering the shadows of the self one must build a solid and strong \\n  101 101 foundation, for the cthonic daemons of the mind shall devour \\nand destroy the unwary fool who would invoke the darkside. The Zos Ki\\na Cultus is based on the foundations of \\nunified Will, Desire and Belief. The combination of each bestows a strong method of \\n\\nsorcery which leads to impacting and signifi\\ncant results. The essence of the Zos Kia \\nCultus exists within the inspired self cons\\ntantly reshaping itself. Through this process \\ninherent desire  become materially ex\\nistent through diving \\nthe depths of the \\nsubconscious. \\n \\nAtavisms are present within the primal world \\nof magick because they are a reversion of \\nconsciousness to an earlier form. For this re\\nason too, such daemonic forms often take the \\nshape of horrific or deformed Elementals. These are constantly changing shape and \\n\\ncollecting in green, red or black mist, swirling in\\n the depths of the dark side of the brain. \\nSuch can be useful indeed. Atavisms are implem\\nented as a tool in focusing belief and will \\nuntil desire is crystal clear. Then within seconds of discovery of the hidden desire, the \\n\\nconscious mind forgets so that the subcons\\ncious may make it reality. Atavisms and \\nElementals are nothing more than servitor\\ns and deliverers of the dreams of the mind. \\nThey serve the able sorcerer who is thus\\n able to control his or her surroundings. The Death Posture is a tool for forgetting th\\ne formulated belief and transferring it from \\nthe conscious into the subconscious. This is a further interpla\\ny of the active mind with the \\nsleeping essence of self in zero form. By co\\nmmunicating via the use of Sentient Symbols \\n(the language which is compos\\ned of sigils) one may deal \\ndirectly with the atavisms, \\nwhich exist in the depths of the subconscious, \\nand in turn charge the desire to become \\nreality. \\nThis is where the dangers of sorcery exis\\nt. Whoever communicates with atavisms, and \\ncharges the subconscious with \\nbelief and desire, may find things come to pass in ways \\none would not wish them to. Be cautious in\\n your sorceries and invoke not that which \\nwould devour you. There is a great mystery, a chalice of veiled \\necstasy awaiting those w\\nho taste of the death \\n- dream - sex gnosis by which we awake thr\\nough dream into waking flesh. The inherent \\ndream is aligned with Thelema, based on \\nthe combination of sexual focus and will \\ntowards a desired effect. Crowleys \"Book of th\\ne Law\" states the following in connection \\nto Babalon (made to manifest in the Scar\\nlet Woman) and Nuit (whom Spare sought to \\nembody in the Zos Kia Cultus) \"But to love \\nme is better than all things: if under the \\nnight-stars in the desert thou \\npresently burnest mine incense\\n before me, invoking me with \\na pure heart, and the Serpent flame therein, thou shalt come a little to lie in my bosom. \\n\\nFor one kiss wilt thou then be willing to give\\n all; but whoso gives one particle of dust \\nshall lose all in that hour.\" (Liber Al vel Legis. I. 61) A partial difference is recognized between Magi\\nck and Sorcery. Magick is the essence of \\nthe Sun, being the conscious rise towards \\nGodhead. This suggests the key god form of \\nmagickal work is Lucifer, the Bringer of Wi\\nsdom and the Angel of Light. Magick is of \\nelevation and the noble control of th\\ne Will through focus and discipline. \\nSorcery and Witchcraft are most significant to\\n Magick itself due to the essence of such. \\nSorcery is the reverse of the Solar Path, it is \\nof the Moon, hereditary \\nof the exploration of \\natavisms and the hidden aspects of the \\nself. Sorcery is the child of Asmodeus, \\ndemon/angel of flesh made pleasure and dr\\nawing towards the sleeping self. Lilith and \\n  102 102 Hecate are both the mother of witchcraft a\\nnd sorcery,  lunar fountains emanating the \\nwitch blood which all flows backwards into form. \\nZos represents and is considered \\'The B\\nody as a Whole\\', symbo\\nlising the mind, body and \\nspirit. Zos is represented by the Eye or Vulva of woman, that which executes the \\n\\nimagination. Kia is the atmospheric \"I\", an astr\\nal cosmic self connected to its latent desire \\nand activity.  Kia is the Hand or Phallus of man, which makes incarnate the Will. The \\n\\nresult of their union being manifestation th\\nrough will and desire. \\nThe union of the hand \\nand eye is termed by Spare as \\'Becoming all sensation\\'. An ocean of dead forms, shaped \\n\\naccording to their past loves and lusts, by which flesh is made known through belief. \\n\\nSigil making, a form of what ZOS termed \\'Sentie\\nnt Symbols\\' (18) , is a pictorial means of \\nenfleshing the desire by belief\\n and exhaustion (i.e. sexual \\nor sensory deprivation). The \\nghosts urge a flow with each drop of bl\\nood given from the mouth of Asmodeus and \\nHecate. Continual streams of \\ninspiration cascade in fountaine\\nsque patterns of lunar sight. \\nThe effect of \\'sigilization\\' or \\n\\' sigil making \\' is not a means of explaining the sorceries of \\nZOS, however only a useful tool or method of \\nfocus made flesh.  Sigils can be made in \\nANY WAY  which is useful a\\nnd inspirational to the sorcerer, in whom the desire of \\nbelief is to awaken the onward and creative fl\\now of inspiration. The Gods speak through \\nour sparkling inner sight, through our joy, anger, love and hate. The source and definition of Sp\\nares sorcery lies within the witch cult that fueled his \\ninspiration. Yelg Paterson, a figure shrouded in \\nmystery, gives answers in the light of the \\nmoon between dusk and dawn where the veil \\nis thin. Any working to contact Witch \\nMother Paterson demands individual interpre\\ntation or fictional inspiration to create \\nbelief, and later manifestation, within the i\\nndividual. The Zos Kia Cultus must be an \\nindividual development, crea\\nted as his or her own system\\n based around the alphabet of \\ndesire. The finer applications \\nof such a system operate ac\\ncording to individual knowledge \\nand interest. \\n   103 103  Nu - Moon Rite Atavistic Resurgence  Nuit, Goddess of space and the night sky, proves \\nto be a significant ke\\ny to attainment of \\nhidden knowledge and magickal development. \\nThe hidden knowledge I speak of is the of \\nthe vast, and often unexplored, subconscious \\nsymbolised by the Night Sky or Space. The \\nadventure of exploration is the secret of the developmen\\nt of the individual sorcerer. Animal atavisms which inhabit the human brai\\nn can be categorized \\nas two types. Some \\ntypify  forms of pre-human consciousness; ot\\nher strains have linked themselves with the \\nhuman  psyche and genetics. In the final analys\\nis either kind  can be defined as totems by \\nShamans. Lycanthropy is nothing more than r\\nites of atavistic resu\\nrgence, either on a \\ndream level, in which the Egyptians were so \\nskilled; or upon the waking level: as when \\nstrength or stealth are obtained or invoked during moments of dire need. \\nAustin Osman Spare\\'s image of \"Nu Moon Rite\\n\" (illustrated in Kenneth Grant\\'s \"Aleister \\nCrowley and the Hidden God\", published by SKOOB) holds significant keys to atavistic \\nresurgence. It is often the case with the pain\\ntings of AOS, as his true hidden genius was \\nhis art, that many keys of magickal study \\ncan be obtained through \\nmeditating upon them. \\nThe drawing presents several faces, some an\\nimal, some human and others a combination \\nof both. The many keys which exist in the art \\nand writings of AOS are  paramount. Those \\nwho sip from the cup of H\\necate shall taste the essence of their own personal Holy \\n  104 104 Guardian Angel, the True Will Discovered. This provides the essential clarity and \\nstability, the strength of conviction, directi\\non and will required to flourish in the pursuit \\nof magick and sorcery. To c\\nontrol and materialize your wi\\nll upon earth one must first \\nmaster all within the night si\\nde, that of dreaming... All will \\nthen manifest in due course. \\nThe Lunar aspect of the formula is essential,\\n as the birth force. The balanced formula \\nconjoins the Sun (male energy) and Moon \\n(female energy) for creation and birth. \\nThe Nu Moon Rite was constructed after th\\ne image of AOS for the use of awakening \\nsleeping atavisms, for purposes of obtaining \\nstrength, stealth, introspection or magickal \\nknowledge. The ritual involves the use of lycan\\nthropic masks. The mask should be made \\nor accented by yourself and should be made to \\nsymbolize the essence of the atavism you \\nwish to awaken. Approach th\\ne rite with incense and any \\ntrappings which would add to \\nthis context of  ritualistic lycanthropy. \\n\\n \\n \"Black streamed mother of night\\n, casting transparent enveloping \\nshadows \\nVeiling the secrets of Infinite Sp\\nace beneath the flames of your \\nsabbath. \\nShine your star upon me, pleasure of the night mask, \\n\\nFor I invoke the hidden mysteries! \\nThe spirit of the _________ I invoke \\nto become as thee and be thee! \\n\\nSelf love is the avatar of all Gods, \\nOf which the sickle moon holds the very life! \\n\\nI breathe with the stealth of night \\nTo see beyond the veil of dreams\" \\n  \\nFocus intently upon the sigil until you memorize it. \\n \\n \"Awaken Hecate! Through the serpents kiss \\n\\nunder the moon of blood our sleep becomes waking, \\n\\nmemories of our past flesh become present memory\" \\n \\nThe sigil should now be consecr\\nated with sexual fluid and th\\nen absorbed and destroyed. \\nThe sorcerer should now banish and forget. \\nYour dreams that evening, if you focus upon \\nthe spirit invoked, should\\n reflect the level of \\nthe subconscious where the spirit dwells. A \\nuseful aspect of the atavism rite is to ca\\nll upon it in the time of\\n need. If you require \\nstealth, speed or strength simply recall the si\\ngil mentally and bri\\nng forth it\\'s immense \\npower. \\n \\n Invocation of the Witch Mother   105 105  This is an Elemental working to evoke the \\ninfluence of Witch Moth\\ner Paterson. Such an \\nElemental would be ideal in \\nthe search for Witches Sabbat\\n knowledge, or inspiration.  \\nUse an image of Paterson, of which Spar\\ne has drawn several, or create your own \\naccording to your mental picture of the Witch \\nMother.

This Elemental shall be born of such desire. This Elemental can serve one of two \\n\\npurposes, though only one should be selected. Th\\nese purposes are firs\\ntly sexual congress, \\nwhich presents the danger of obsession wh\\nich should be avoided at all costs. \\nAlternatively, extracting craft wisdom in th\\nis spirit form can manifest knowledge in \\nvarious ways. Among the most interesting of\\n these is Automatic writing, where thoughts \\nof the Yelg image inspire writings which provi\\nde useful information. This may be either \\nfinely detailed or disorganised and highly sy\\nmbolic. Significant knowledge in the form of \\nvoices or pictures may also be accessed in multilayered dreams. Once the particular goal \\n\\nof the evocation is performed, the witch should \\nbanish and destroy the \\nsigil, to reabsorb \\nand uncreate this Elemental. The purpose be\\ning to avoid obsession which could derive \\nfrom long term contact with such a spirit. \\n\\n \\nOracles of Zos and Kia \\n\\n \\n\"As I laid upon the crimson sheets I felt the co\\nld, numbing  hands of Hecate lull my body \\nto sleep.

An intrusive familiar is \\nan automata or Elemental with a degree of \\ndetachment (under will) from the sorcerers \\nsubconscious. Such Elementals, if already \\nexisting outside of the sorcerers mind, then \\ngrow from an automatic Elemental or servitor \\nto a seeming spirit with a driven nature of \\nits own. It is up to the sorcerer to make use \\nof the automata of the subconscious to form \\nan intrusive Elemental to remain under control of will. This can be a dangerous operation \\n\\nif the magickian is not skilled in sorcer\\ny and invocation/evocation. Spirits which are called from the atavisms of the depths of the \\nmind are often horrific and self destructive if \\nnot properly controlled and channeled. This can\\n lead to cases of \\nmadness, schizophrenia, \\neven what some lower religions call \"posse\\nssion\". One of the more significant spirits \\nwhich we have worked with was one called Black Eagle. \\nOur work with Black Eagle began in 1998 upo\\nn discovering a significant image of the \\nspirit. Black Eagle is described as an Amer\\nican Indian guide, but we have uncovered \\nnumerous vampiric elements of it\\'s nature. A \\nfeature of this is that during dreams Black \\nEagle will appear in a blood red or black ba\\nckground, as if  you are \\nentering its plane of \\nexistence. This is why I refer to Black Eagle \\nas a spirit beyond definition as an Elemental. \\nI had first approached Black Eagle as a Qliipot\\nhic spirit, this was not entirely correct as \\nBlack Eagle was an American Indian spirit.\\n American Indian Sorcerers were actually \\nShamans who practiced a high di\\nscipline, entering alte\\nrnate states of be\\ning, the self same \\nstates that Spare termed as \"Neither - \\nNeither\" - the Abyss. The underworld and the \\nwaking world were often explored in depth c\\nonnections between the spirit and the flesh. \\nMany such journeys or explorations were \\nunder the web of sleep where dream becomes \\nflesh. Shamans are masters of th\\ne in between worlds, from wh\\nence witchcraft derives - it \\nis a mastery of both flesh and spirit. The adep\\nt of such magick and sorcery is bound to the \\nearth, and with numerous skills and practice \\ncan later leave the physical body at will in \\norder to go between worlds. Or even  to take\\n on the flesh of another. A wise Sorcerer \\nwould seek to master both the methods of \\nShaman and Magickian, both the solitary and \\nthe Ceremonial, great keys of\\n knowledge exist through both. Black Eagle appears often as a pale Indian \\nspirit, either black, blue or red robed. \\nSometimes this ‚Elemental™ appears in brown le\\nather hides, with leathery skin which is \\nabnormally pale and with burning black eyes. \\nThere have been occasions however when \\nBlack Eagle had no precise form at all, manifest\\ning merely as a gray or different coloured \\nshapeless mass. Communication with Black \\nEagle is either done\\n through it showing \\nimages to your mind or through words, either \\na tongue which is not easily understood or \\nwith a heavy north American Indian accent. \\n\\nIf the mind is clear of dogma concerning Blac\\nk Eagle, then one w\\nill obtain clear speech \\nat some point. This is where one should im\\nplement the use of a magickal diary or \\nnotebook next to your bed. Upon waking, one shoul\\nd take extensive notes of all of the \\nimages and words that appeared to you. The \\nevocation method of Black Eagle is simple \\nyet effective. You must first obain a clear im\\nage  expressing the essence of Black Eagle. \\nBe warned however, this spirit is not to\\n be played with and can induce madness or \\nsomething worse. \\n\\nSeveral interesting questions to pose to the student would be the following: ·If Black Eagle is merely an Elemental, why would such appear much more powerful \\n\\nthan any normal servitor that one would have created? \\n  108 108 ·If Black Eagle is already a spirit connected with vampiris\\nm, why is one not able to evoke \\nit through the Qlippothic system? \\n\\n·Often such spirits are bound to the earth, as within rites of Black Magick and Sorcery, could such eventually take the flesh of another? \\n\\n \\n-Our work with Black Eagle ha\\ns proven it to be a very powe\\nrful vampire spirit, adept in \\nsorceries which would possible cause a initia\\nte student to fall prey to its apparent \\n\"charms\". Proceed with caution because such a mighty Daemon knows no compassion \\n\\nfor the naked spirit. Substance is substance. Once a sigil is consecrated, the spirit may \\n\\nmanifest in various ways and not always for \\nthe best. It is signifi\\ncant to mention however \\nthat if one sought to evoke/invoke such an\\n Elemental the purpose must be clear and \\nprecise when transmitted to such an entity. \\n\\n \\n-Qlippothic spirits and Elementals are often \\'she\\nlls\\' or shades of th\\ne dead, given substance by astral blood or \\'chi\\' from the living. Qli\\nppothic spirits which exist beyond the sphere \\nof Da™ath are sometimes very powerful yet dir\\nectionless. Given this \\ntendency the sorcerer with a strong will can channel and control such a daemon wit\\nhout falling prey. Qlippothic spirits are generally not \\'earth-bound\\' per se but\\n operate between the lines of the outer or \\nastral world. Once they are evoked however, \\nand given a vessel such as a consecrated \\nbottle or sigil, then they remain earth-\\nbound until banished or absorbed. The rites of \\nvampirism call for their evocation and u\\nltimate absorption for individual power and \\ninsight into the Daemonic or Cthonic realm. \\n\\n \\n-Qlippothic Elementals become dangerous if co\\nnsecrated and left to their own devices by \\nnot being assigned one particul\\nar task or purpose and NOT ba\\nnished and absorbed. They \\nwill grow in their essence by f\\needing from the binder until they \\neither find another host or \\ntake the flesh and mind of the sorcerer w\\nho originally summoned them. The magick of \\nSolomon and the nature of his work\\n point clearly to this danger.  \\nDaemons which are bound to th\\ne earth generally exist betw\\neen the astral and living \\nworld, jumping from one to the other. Their will\\n remains intact as well as much of their \\npersonality. Over a period of time these spir\\nits will gradually fade from existence, \\nsubsisting only as poltergeists or other such \\nnearly harmless shades until oblivion claims \\nthem. This is the prime difference between Qlippothic and \\'outer\\' spirits and earth bound \\n\\n\\'ghosts\\'. \\n\\nThe danger which comes from earth bound blac\\nk magickians who leave their flesh in \\ndeath is that the possibility of  becoming \\na vampire is imminent. Vampire spirits exist \\nbetween both worlds just as ghosts and suc\\nh, however their personalities and astrals \\nremain intact due to the fact that they drai\\nn life force from earthly \\nliving creatures. The \\nmain victims are humans who, unknowingly, call out to them in dreams. Thus the \\n\\nvampire spirit will go from body to body, guided by \\nthe individual sleeper, and drink of \\ntheir life force. Some magickians have the \\nability of eventually entering the flesh of \\nanother and continuing their existence in this\\n manner. Many tales of\\n possession were also \\nspawned this way. \\nA mistake is often made concerning Daemonic \\nspirits such as those of ‚The Goetia of \\nSolomon™ and others of similar type. Aleister\\n Crowley wrote that su\\nch spirits represent \\n  109 109 parts of the brain, but this is \\nnot entirely true. While Elementals such as these have roles \\nand names by which we align them with  the \\nsubconscious, the essence of such a being is \\nactually of two parts, being astral as well \\nas mental. The combination of both ultimately \\nis the formula of their manifestation. This of course is subject to the most significant rule \\n\\nof magick, sorcery and all forms of evocation/invocation: Will, Desire, Belief. \\n\\nThe essence of such spirits is of the Qli\\nppoth and in order to bind them an object or \\ntalisman must be employed. These can be rath\\ner simple in nature but very potent - even \\ndangerous - in terms of   practical results.\\n It is through the rapi\\nd procession of ritual \\ngnosis that one is able to transpire the body of ego and step outside the flesh. There exist several images of Black Eagle, by which Spare offers even further valuable \\n\\ninspiration. The spirit can be contacted via \\nthe images which AOS created, of which he \\nbelieved, each line holds a consistent contact\\n point which would invoke this Elemental. \\nBlack Eagle is viewed by myself and Coven \\nNachttoter as a vampiric spirit, existing \\nthrough the backwards cycle of the neither-ne\\nither concepts. He l\\neads those in contact \\nwith him into the \\'fruitful grove\\' of the mi\\nnd, whence all desires emerge, by means of the \\nId familiars created by the sorcerer. \\n\\nBlack Eagle is the ideal object of an evocat\\nion, for vampiric exploration (in the dream \\nstate), for the purposes of obtai\\nning knowledge, or feeding from\\n chi or lunar \\nlife force. I \\nam therefore giving a detailed description of \\nthe techniques, and a record of one of the \\nworkings, conducted by Coven Maleficia . Th\\ne purpose of this rite is to obtain \\nastral/dream contact with this spirit who \\nreportedly fueled a porti\\non of the Salem witch \\ncult. \\nThe altar should feature traditional candles, num\\nerous flowing colors which are attractive \\nor hold some magickal signifi\\ncance to you personally. Images\\n of Black Eagle should also \\nbe hung around the altar. AOS cr\\neated several different images\\n of this spirit which are \\nworthy of a search. It is also recommended and even more magically potent to create \\nyour own sigil or painting of Black Eagle. \\nIncense smoke should be billowing throughout \\nthe chamber. The altar should \\nbe adorned with human or an\\nimal bones. This represents \\nthe connection to the earth as well as a summoning tool of\\n spirits. Ancient Tibetan monks \\nwould create human thigh bone trumpets to \\npurify and to summon the dead, holding in \\ntheir temples great occult energies which coul\\nd be harnessed for nearly any magickal act. \\nHuman bones are obtainable from various me\\ndical supply companies, offering generally \\nreasonable prices. You may wish \\nto charge bones to be  ma\\ngickal tools by consecrating \\nthem with your blood or sexual fluid, followe\\nd by sigils or talismans. If a skull is \\navailable then the sigil of Black Eagle may be painted on it, as it can then be used as a \\n\\nfocus and material basis for the Elemental. \\n\\n   110 110  (Sigil of Black Eagle)  Evocation of Black Eagle  Bones should be made into the sign of an \\'X\\n\\', representing the crossing from the day side \\n(waking) into the night side \\n(dream - astral) as well as the Crossroads themselves. The \\nsorcerer should then burn, in a small cauld\\nron, incense of jasmine and frankincense and \\nconcentrate upon the sigil of Black Ea\\ngle. Facing the altar, Intone:  \\nﬁSpirit of the elder spheres, that of water, earth fire and air thee I invoke!

From \\nBlack Eagle, who has walked along the crims\\non and wave engulfed dr\\neamscapes, we had \\n  111 111 images which fleshed in the waking world as\\n symbols and flourishing art. These were \\ngiven life by Soror Davcina and word by A\\nkhtya Seker Arimanius, shadows that \\ntranscend personality as Coven Maleficia. Al\\nl things to be regarded as beautiful and \\nhideous. The gates we crashed open called \\nnot only Black Eagle \\nbut numerous other \\nElementals, spirits and daemons of great insp\\niration and maliciousness. To protect, from \\nthe latter of which, we must build our astral walls. \\nEach night I had been visited, haunted a\\nnd called to by a mysterious woman. I later \\nunderstood her personality as an extension of\\n Yelg Paterson,  I had tried to keep a \\ndistance from her, not knowing the sensual da\\nnger and passion which could be mine for \\nthe taking. The desire was catching up with me, \\nnot just for any mere sexual congress, for \\nsomething greater, more powerful and dynamic than before. I searched for this lady only \\n\\nby her invitation. I could feel a cold wind ta\\nke me from my chamber window. This of \\ncourse by my own acceptance. I understood that\\n I had actually known her once, in order \\nto be waking into her dream. She was within \\na cold, stone constructed ruin of a building, \\nsomething of an ancient temple. Worn with ag\\ne and often bitter temp\\neratures, I could feel \\nthe vast solar and nocturnal rites which had \\ntaken place long before. Time frozen traces \\nof Solar birth rites, and ceremonies which \\ncelebrated strength and joy. These ruins now \\nheld the tomb and chamber of\\n my woman who continued to call me. It was her essence, \\nextended astrally, which caused me something like the day side loss of  breath. I felt cold \\n\\nyet strong. Strength was because of lack of fear. \\n\\nThe snow which collected in this forgotten \\ntemple only added to the sense of isolation \\nand what desolate kind of place \\nit was. I could hear some ki\\nnd of predatory birds in the \\nbackground. Perhaps they were ravens or such, \\nthey seemed to fly closer and then break \\naway into the distance. This \\nsound  went in a cycle, or \\nso it seemed, from the time I \\nbegan approaching this lair. \\nThe arched doorway, old heavy oak carved into\\n a lavish and noble wolf head, guarded \\nagainst any approach. Since I felt welcomed and wanted it was by that urging I entered \\nthe doorway. I do not recall spec\\nific details on the exact layout\\n of the rooms except they \\nwere lit by dim burning candles. I felt her essen\\nce close by, so I drew my astral further \\ninto the chambers, until I found myself going \\ndown a staircase made of stone. The stone, \\neven in this blue toned light, was gray and wo\\nrn. There is a kind of pride and character to \\nold brick and stone, often worn w\\nith stories of age and struggle\\n. I knew a part of myself  \\nwas home as I drifted down each stair. It is\\n a very odd and surreal feeling to know a part \\nof you is home especially if you have never tr\\naveled there.  I only knew a mistress from \\nthe shadows, whose ivory white hand seem\\ned so smooth and comforting, beckoned me \\nevery moment. I was anxiously waiting for the \\nmoment when I could see her again. This \\ntime I knew I would not avoid her or resist her \\ncall. I knew also that\\n she was quite aware \\nof my presence, but not when she would \\nmake herself known to me. I could feel \\nsomething of her all around; a scent of some \\nbeautiful old fragrance.\\n So beautiful a tear \\nwould catch in your eye and you would know\\n you were home. The sense of strength \\nwhich permeated the incense \\nsaturated atmosphere was choking. Not in a stifling or \\nnegative way, but making one qu\\nite aware that the lady of the ruins has conisderable \\ncontrol here. \\nI felt a sense of heat as I reached a cham\\nber door which was made of the same quality \\nwood which adorned the front entrance. As I stood there for those moments, time seemed \\n\\nto grow even slower, as if I had chosen\\n it that way by some backwards means of \\n  112 112 telepathy. I was beginning to \\nobserve countless shapes which were products of many \\ndreams and nightmares flowing in chaos with \\neach other. Each face would take on the \\nattribute of what people genera\\nlly consider beautiful and go to the extreme of ugliness, \\neven demonic, with a se\\nnse of darkness and poison. I felt no fear but fascination, a \\ndeep calling to the le\\nvels of my mind so often touched by \\nthis beauty. Was this a creation of hers or \\nmy own? Perhaps both the more I think about \\nit. I started through the wooden door, etched wi\\nth a wolf head and what could be celtic \\ncarvings. Once I passed through the door I knew \\nshe would be waiting, as she always had \\nbeen. As I passed through I ga\\nined sight of the chamber a\\nnd finally the witch. She stood \\nprominent in the shadows of the room, standing behind a slow burning fire. Robed and \\n\\nhooded in black and what could \\nbe night blue, she was soun\\nding a beautiful and almost \\nhaunting mantra, by which the quality of he\\nr voice was displayed. It seemed to be both \\nfairy-tale like and haunting at the same ti\\nme, as if a dual or double headed spirit was \\nmade manifest through her. \\n\\nI could finally see her eyes \\nas I drew closer, how dark \\nthey were, reflecting a burning \\npassion I had only known through a Scarlet Woma\\nn. How deeply I yearned for the taste \\nof her astral flesh, that which was formed\\n through her own thought and will. The lips, \\ngray yet with a red hue to them, were somewhat full and sensual. Her robes as I studied \\n\\nwere even more ornate than I had previous\\nly noticed. The black material on the collar \\nwas decorated with many sigils and seals. I no\\nticed too some very eccentric designs that \\nadded to the flavor of her overall appearance. \\nOnce her mantra was finished, she focused upon\\n my appearance and stature on the astral \\nplane. I took no beast like form at the moment, I appeared in the vestments of the \\n\\nceremony, robed and hooded. The witch took sinuous\\n steps towards me, with the grace of \\na cat or other predatory animal, as if to ta\\nste her prey. With both hands she took down my \\nhood and withdrew slightly. As she was close to me it was her \\nwill to take her hood off as \\nwell. I could now see the beauty which she possessed within this sphere of stored energy.  \\nWatching her intently I understood why I was \\nhere, what brought me here, and why she \\nstared so purposefully upon my every move. \\n\\nI embraced her, only to feel a \\nsurge of electricity and chaos.\\n I felt a star of burning edges \\nglow above us, shaking the astral foundation of her domain. I felt so alive at that moment, \\nknowing it would not last forever but in my\\n dreams and memory... There was a transfer \\nof energy, a sacrifice to each other. I could \\nfeel the strength of her embrace as she could \\nsurely feel mine... a woman of red, blue and \\nblack passions which surged through ever \\naspect of her being. \\nIt was then that a flash occu\\nrred and we were apart. I \\nwas floating through a corridor \\nwithin her temple... I was moving below gr\\nound at a steady pace. These ruins were \\nbeautiful... so dark, shadow like \\nand serene. Yet in all of this\\n, a touch of the sinister and \\nthe macabre still lingered. I however find that \\nmost appealing of all. I began to notice \\nremains of the dead. Mostly co\\nrpses, white eyes still lay intact within them... staring upon what must have been Da™ath. As I entered a chamber at the end of the corridor I \\n\\nunderstood that this room was an ancient mortuary, a room of rest as I would call it. A \\n\\ndozen or more corpses were at various point\\ns of the room. The scent was beautiful and \\ncold, the smell of the dead floated through th\\ne air... covering all in a blanket of decay. \\nThis was not the rotting smell mind you, nothi\\nng so sickening, it was an ancient scent \\nreminiscent of the dead. The dead in the room\\n had another characteri\\nstic along with their \\n  113 113 white eyeballs. They were also surrounded \\nby a gray-blue colored energy field, which was their astral body. For some \\nreason this form had not faded \\nin death as in most cases, \\nbut rested in and around each body. A death-mask \\nof a skull like face covered each head, \\nfloating in ghostlike energy. I felt very comfor\\ntable here... perhaps the dead were created \\nElementals who served the sexual desires of \\nthe witch with whom \\nI had grown mutually \\nfond. \\n \\nSwift and sudden came her entrance to that ch\\namber. She appeared \\nas a great and noble \\nLady, her respectability overtak\\nen by the force of overwhe\\nlming passion. I observed as \\nonly I could do at this moment\\n, watching every move in a c\\nontrolled state of astral \\nawakening. She was no longer clothed in the \\nfinery in which I made her acquaintance \\nhowever. A black night robe adorned he\\nr body, with crimson red flower petals \\nembroidered upon it, with what seemed to be nothing underneath. \\n\\nHer astral flesh had formed itself into so re\\nfined and haunting a beauty. Ivory white flesh \\nso smooth and tight, her own devised psyc\\nho-physical ‚desire \\nbody™ was exhilarating. Her breasts were firm and ample, in k\\neeping with her lean, well proportioned body. She \\nstood near the center of the chamber, holding \\nout her arms towards the ceiling, and her \\nrobe opened to bare her beautiful body even\\n further. I glimpsed at her method of \\nsummoning the dead. \\nThe witch began chanting a mantra composed \\nof a short sentence, which rolled off her \\ntongue with beauty and grace, like an age ol\\nd song in a forgotten language. The spirits \\nbegan encircling her in a torna\\ndo like spirit storm. I felt \\nher mind enter ecstasy, passion \\nand control beyond every limit of wh\\nat is possible. I wanted to \\njoin in so much but could \\ndo nought but stand in place and watch, motionless \\nin frozen time.  The dead now seemed \\nto focus in on one particular corpse, a skel\\neton in a white funeral \\nshroud. With her hand \\nshe reached for the corpse and a long and fair\\nly thick white rib was in her possession. \\nThus grasping it she cast a fervent gaze upon it, \\nfull of unspeakable lust and desire. Ivory \\nwhite and very clean looking, this human bone \\nwould prove to be an instrument of joy \\nand desire this evening. The witch lowered \\nit  to her vagina and with a stroking, slow \\npace, proceeded to glide it through her lips and in\\nto the entrance. I heard the cries of lust \\nand passion as it began probing into her and he\\nr hand began to move slowly in and out. \\nHer moist astral body seemed so real and so\\n fine that I was gr\\nowing in excitement \\nwatching. I kept my urges controlled even thou\\ngh my own desire wanted her and the dead \\nvery badly. \\nHer hand began moving faster and with more lu\\nst and intent. The s\\nearing sight of human \\nbone going deeper and deeper into her moist ope\\nning fully awakened the fire snake of my \\nastral. The contrast of the white bone with\\n the firm, pale flesh of her legs was an \\nastonishing view. It was AOS \\nwho gave the key, \"Heaven is \\necstasy...\", this WAS heaven \\non the astral plane, or so it felt that evening several years ago. The spirits of the dead and the Elementals w\\nho served this witch began encircling her and her moans and heat grew. I knew the desire she built into this mind-sigil was powerful \\n\\nand beautiful. Much of the spirit-energy \\nseemed to engulf the bone which was being \\ntunneled deep within her. Tunneling with a p\\nace akin to the desire and control I would \\nhave inside of her.  At the moment of clim\\nax, the spirits seemed to explode and dissipate \\nand I felt a blinding  jerk back into my \\nbody. The moment my conscious began coming \\nback I knew my erection in my physical body wa\\ns great. I wanted her but obsession is not   114 114 an option. Only control and st\\nrength. Throughout my life ther\\ne have been times when I \\ncould grow only by being strong \\nand facing the most difficult \\nsituations. Even though my \\nmore reckless urges told me different. I r\\neached a point of waking conscious and gave \\nmyself such comfort, I had met this speci\\nal witch... I would meet her again I knew. Obsession can develop if the sorcerer becomes \\ntoo involved with the desire for meeting, \\nor for an experience, such that the consci\\nous becomes entirely focused on it. Obsession \\nbecomes failure due to the fact that the subc\\nonscious is not able to set in motion the \\nproper paths for the desire to become flesh. Th\\ne conscious must forget the desire as much \\nas possible and focus on something else. Once this can be done, the desire will become a \\n\\nfact based in flesh. If not, failure results in\\n abiding anger in the i\\nndividual, and leads to further troubles down the road. \\n Creation of Elementals  \\n\" \\'All things are subject to resurrection™, \\nthus spake smiling Aaos, on rising from the \\ndead. Then turning towards his shadow, \\'I\\n come! The changing word that destroys \\nreligion, a vortex wind that shall jest in temples!\\'\" - (AOS The Focus of Life) \\n \\nElementals are described as created spirits \\nwhich are connected to the sorcerer\\'s will. \\nMany of these are created in highly intense rites which can either be hermetic or \\n\\nceremonial in nature. It is however of ma\\njor importance that the sorcerer does not \\nbecome obsessed with his creations, as Elementals can become uncontrollable. Such \\n\\nspirits can be made manifest \\nor created through an act of at\\navistic resurgence, which is \\ndescribed in the creation rite\\n. Elementals should be bound by \\nthe powers of a particular \\nelement such as water, fire, air or earth. The \\nSorcerer would also bind an Elemental to an \\nobject, as for instance a vase, a sigil painted \\nor drawn on paper, a box, a doll, etc.. If one \\nwished to destroy or absorb the Elemental once its task was complete then the ideal \\n\\nmethod would be to destroy \\nthe object in the course of\\n a banishing ritual. When \\nElementals are born of atavistic desires then\\n the control aspect wi\\nll come to test the \\nsorcerers mental strength and control. Elemen\\ntals, as mentioned before, can be used as \\nprotectors of the body when in astral proj\\nection/dreaming, and carry\\n forth spells and \\nworkings. They act as a subconscious messenge\\nr, focused on one object or goal which is \\nthe desire. It is for this reason that one doe\\ns not become  allow any particular Elemental \\nspirit to develop to the poi\\nnt where it can obsess the mi\\nnd. If allowed to do so the \\nElemental can wreak havoc on many levels, \\ncausing a growing form of madness, for \\nwhich Choronzon awaits. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n   115 115 Chapter Four Rituals of the Red Temple Lycanthropy and the Witches Moon \\n The following chapter deals with \\npotent and potentially dangerous \\nrituals. These workings are \\n\\ndesigned in accord with a \\n\\nformula, permitting the \\n\\nindividual to awaken and control \\n\\nlycanthropic and beast like \\natavisms which lay dormant in \\n\\nthe mind. The purpose is not by \\n\\nany means to propagate violence \\n\\nbut to present  useful path \\n\\nworkings for the sorcerer. Thus \\n\\nthey nay practice, develop and \\n\\nlearn control on the day side as \\n\\nwell as the night side plane. \\n\\nThese rituals are developed from \\nmany years working formulas \\n\\nfrom old Grimoires and obscure \\n\\nsystems. These are often \\n\\nmislabeled and hidden from the \\n\\ngeneral public out of fear and \\n\\nmis-understanding. \\n\\nMany of these rites may be \\n\\nperformed either in chambers, \\n\\ncaves, woods or fields when the \\n\\nmoon is waxing in the night sky. \\nIt is of highest importance that \\nyou have the privacy to enter \\n\\nthese states in peace, with no \\n\\nuninitiated people disturbing \\n\\nyou. Such workings require \\nutmost concentration and would ther\\nefore be ruined \\nif interrupted. \\nThese beginning rites are based on Lycanthropy, however their real significance concerns \\nfinding ones individual animal atav\\nism. Lying dormant in the sorcerers brain is an animal \\npower suitable for atavistic e\\nxploration. This could be a Tiger, Eagle, Fox, Raven, Wolf \\nor some other creature. You are encourag\\ned to find which suits your own needs and \\ndesires. The most important thing in magi\\nck is that you learn from and of yourself \\nthrough honesty. Explore all and question everything. One should remember that all is \\nsubject to change and alterati\\non as the sorcerer sees fit. \\nNothing is sacred beyond the \\nlimits of acceptance and lies. \\n\\n   116 116 Obtaining the Devil™s Skin \\n This initiation rite of the Red Temple \\nshould be performed on the full moon. The \\nreasoning behind this is that the moon in its\\n various phases affects water in numerous \\nways. As humans are around ninety percent wa\\nter it is obvious enough that we can be \\naffected to. The trick if you will is to make th\\nis work for the sorcerer. This rite may be \\nperformed indoors in a suitable chamber, de\\ncorated for this particular working, or \\noutdoors where privacy can be had. \\nIf this lycanthropic \\nritual is to be worked outdoors, it \\nis strongly recommended that you build your own \\naltar in the forest.  Above the altar, on \\nthe tree chosen, a sigil designed to signify the wolf spirit you are to invoke.  \\nYou should have the following items\\n on the altar once it is prepared: Athame, Sword, Wand, Chalice and Inverted Pentagram \\n\\nA special sigil designed to invoke the werewo\\nlf atavism which shall be consecrated and \\ndestroyed. \\nThe Chalice and elixir \\n\\nWolf skin or item which can be worn as a wolf belt or skin \\n\\nWerewolf Mask \\nThis rite should include an offering of your\\n own blood, which should be\\n held in a goblet \\nor chalice not to be drunk, however but to st\\nore the life force with which the wolf spirit \\nwill be invoked. The chamber or area should be darkened with illuminating candles, \\n\\nsigils should be painted on the body: \\nThe sigil of the spirit Marchosias (1) obtai\\nned from the Goetia of Solomon, from the \\nauthor\\'s personal experience, this spirit™s ai\\nd proves a significant benefit, and the sigil \\nshould be available for the purpose of visualization. The wolf hook rune \\nThe sign of Luna (the moon and it\\'s current) \\n\\nThe sign of Saturn (Death and transformation) \\n\\nThe sign of Mars (blood and sex) \\nThe wolf skin should be worn \\nPlease note that Mars is also the Planet of \\nWar and aggression Such energies should be \\ncontrolled and channeled through the self. There they are refined as Lycanthropic power \\nwithin the conscious mind, and bound to th\\ne particular Elemental which you are \\ninvoking. A circle should be made on the gr\\nound, around seven feet in diameter,  large \\nenough for one to move about in. This circle\\n should be made count\\ner clock wise and \\nconsecrated with the dagger. It is advised that \\nthe altar be near this circle, so that one is \\nable to still physically touc\\nh the objects on it if necessary. The dagger should be held \\ntowards the werewolf sigil which was made earlier, and the following recited: \\n\\n The Invocation  \"Hail, Hail, Hail great Wolf spirit, HAIL! \\n\\n I invoke thee, o mighty shade \\nWithin this circle I have made. \\n\\nMake me thy werewolf strong and bold \\n  117 117 Dreams of terror and lust, behold! \\nGrant me a figure strong, tall and spare: \\n\\nWith speed of the elk, the claws of a bear; \\n\\nThe poison of snakes, the wit of a fox; The stealth of the wolf, \\nthe strength of an ox; The jaws of the tiger, the teeth of the shark; \\nThe eyes of the cat which sees in the dark! \\n\\n \\nFrom the caverns of night and shade I call thee forth \\n\\nto enter my flesh and make me thy host \\n\\nwe are as one in this web of dreams... \\n\\nfor this is the manifestation of Marchosias; \\n\\nPhantoms of shadow and lycanthropic lust; \\n\\nthis Elemental I now invoke within my essence. \\n\\nFrom the home of the werewo\\nlf, the home of the dead; \\nwith this spirit I thee make!\" \\n \\nBegin a visualization and concentration of th\\ne werewolf sigil, ta\\nke the goblet of blood \\nand make two strikes of blood on the sigil. \\nFocus upon the sigil and a great wolf spirit \\nforming and entering the surroundings.  Breathing \\nat a rapid pace is suggested, as it will \\ndirect the mind towards an altered state of \\nconscious.  Upon reaching this state a mantra \\nshould be chanted and repeated as many tim\\nes as you so desire. The mantra should be \\nformed from something simple as, \"I will be\\ncome as the werewolf\", which if phonetically \\naltered would spell something like \"I w™l \\necom WEREWOLF\". This should be recited \\nwhile focusing upon nothing but the sigil. C\\noncentration should cease momentarily for \\nthe reciting of the following nocturnal oath:  \"I now have invoked the spirit of the werewolf, which shall enter my subconscious and become flesh, \\n\\nDream flesh is a reality so strong. \\n\\nThis oath I give upon my honor \\n\\nTo go beyond the portals of fear and restriction, to make use of each attribute born of past desires; \\n\\nI am that which will shape shift at will, \\n\\nto surpass and devour experiences to come; \\n\\nI behold Marchosias and the wolf spirits! \\nLord of the Forest I now invoke thy lunar power! \\n\\nStrength, joy and regeneration! \\nMy path of freedom and pleasure!\" \\n \\nTake now the chalice of your chosen elixir, and seal now the oath:  \"I drink and open now the current of Luna! Hail!\"  \\nBegin focusing upon the sigil of Marchosias, \\na new mantra being formed: \"Marchosias \\nshall manifest through blood\" b\\necomes \"Marchosias s\\'al mnfest\\n  blood\". Focus upon this \\n  118 118 mantra and sigil, moving your hand and magi\\nckal weapon (usually\\n the dagger) either \\nlaterally or in some \"automatic\" pattern, until \\nthe spirit begins to form. In my experience \\nblood may only give partial life to these spir\\nits, they may only become partially manifest, \\nor incompletely visible. During such manfes\\ntations these spirits ma\\ny make sudden noises, \\nsuch as knocking into something, voices ac\\nross the chamber, scraping noises etc. If \\npossible, take a photograph of these rites, near the altar while you are still in the circle. \\n\\nYou may find such surprises as spirit orbs, gho\\nstlike limbs, figures, lines of spirit energy \\nand similar phenomena. \\n\\nOnce you have entered the ecstasy of evoking the spirit, return once again to your \\n\\ninvocation. \\nBegin a mantra again which should be the same\\n as the first mentioned one (\"I w\\'l ecom \\nWEREWOLF\"), focus with all concentration \\nattainable upon the personal sigil, which \\nyou have consecrated in your blood.  Upon th\\ne climax of words and self congress the \\nsigil should be destroyed by fire and a banishing by laughter performed. You may wish to \\nperform a banishing ritual of the Pentag\\nram or Hexagram, depe\\nnding of course on \\npersonal preference. \\n\\nOnce the sigil is destroyed, toss the ashes \\ninto the wind and go \\nforth in the web of \\ndreams. You will begin noticing astral/dr\\neam transformations and huntings. Others \\nseeking Lycanthropic desires will call or \\ncome to you on the night side. Nightly \\nexchanges of astral blood and sexual union in the form of the beast are not uncommon for \\nthe initiated. \\n\\n Werewolf in Day Side Flesh  \\nThe art of Lycanthropy can be utilized on a \\nday side level as well. I have found after \\ndestroying the consecrated sigil that, when th\\ne need arises, I am able to awaken that \\natavism if I choose. The resu\\nlt has been an increase in phys\\nical strength for endurance \\npurposes, in sexual congress, and in running \\nlong distances; as well as developing an \\nexcellent sense of direction in strange areas, etc. \\nIn the bitter winter of 1995-\\n96 my magickal partner and \\nI found ourselves stranded, \\nwithout transportation,\\n due to the extreme cold and \\nsnow which bombarded the whole \\nstate. We were working with a lot of magickal\\n ideas in those days \\nand nights. It was the \\nopening to the current which would evolve in\\nto what we practice \\ntoday. Living in one \\nroom together we found ourselves feeling \\ncramped and developing a good case of cabin \\nfever. We decided one evening, after a large \\nfall of snow, to walk several miles to a \\nprinting facility to work on some layouts and writings. \\n\\nI found myself outdoors, equipped \\nwith only a light coat, with\\n thin gloves and no hat. \\nThis was a great mistake on my part while \\nmy partner was more suitably dressed. On \\nleaving the house I began telling her how it di\\nd not feel cold and this would be no \\nproblem. About half a mile later I was ravi\\nng quite the opposite. It was exceedingly cold \\nand I found myself in a large amount of pain. \\nI knew I had a fifty-fifty chance of either \\ngetting frost bitten or developing a severe \\ncold. It was my decision however to keep \\ngoing, NO MATTER WHAT, after all this was a \\ntest of endurance and will. We found \\nourselves in the harsh cold for over an hour \\non our way there. I held a gloved hand over \\nmy nose and mouth to avoid breathing in the \\nfrigid night air. En route, I found myself \\ngrowing weak and cold, almost wanting to \\npass out. I then took a moment, while still \\n  119 119 walking, to invoke the wolf spirit. Through this\\n I first contacted what was later known to \\nme as what AOS called an ‚atavism™. After \\na few moments of concen\\ntration I felt a great \\nshadow grow within me, strength pulsat\\ned through my body, powerful enough to block \\nout the severe pain I was going through. I felt only the pressing need to get to the location we were headed. About forty fi\\nve minutes later, of gruelli\\nng slow paced snow \"walking\", \\nwe arrived. The same was the case on the way ho\\nme, which was just as cold if not colder. \\nThough I did learn caution from the experien\\nce it is nonetheless \\npleasant, and even essential, to know one is capable of calling \\nforth an animal atavism when the occasion \\ndemands. \\n\\n The Beast Takes Flesh \\n Everything which is \\n\\ninvolved in the \\n\\nharnessing of Atavistic \\n\\nurges and desires, may \\n\\ntake flesh in the physical \\n\\nsense as well. This \\n\\nmethod, if properly \\n\\ncontrolled, can prove to \\n\\nbe very useful and \\n\\neffective for the sorcerer \\nwho is eager to explore \\n\\nthe darkest recesses of \\n\\nthe mind.  I would \\n\\nsuggest creating a sigil \\n\\nbased on obtaining the \\npower and spirit of the \\n\\nwolf. \\nThis can be described as: \\nIwltneowrfW\\n (I will \\nobtain the power of the \\n\\nWolf) \\n\\nArrange each letter to \\n\\nform an image, in any \\n\\ndesired pattern until the \\n\\nwords are seemingly lost \\n\\nwithin themselves. The \\n\\ngoal is of course to forget \\nthe meaning,  not to be \\n\\nreminded of it. \\n\\nUpon the creation of the \\n\\nsigil, it should be \\n\\nconsecrated. I have \\n\\nfound that sigils which \\n\\nare consecrated twice \\n  120 120 (both beginning and later in the rite, minutes \\nbefore destruction of sigil) have a powerful \\nsphere of energy around them.  The wolf sigil may be embellished with nocturnal \\n\\nemblems and lunar images, less boldly portrayed\\n than the main sigil. By use of such \\ncorresponding symbolism the lycanthropic power\\n may be further refined and attracted. \\nSuch symbols as a crescent moon and \\nyour personal power sign are always \\nrecommended. Please be aware though, by doi\\nng such a rite you are invoking a very \\ndangerous part of yourself, which the mi\\nnd does not normally consciously occupy. The \\nbeast itself will rise to the surface in res\\nponse to the call. One should not attempt this \\nshaman-witch rite until considerable Will and self control has been attained. \\n\\nA triangle should be prepared\\n in the room of choice, ta\\nking care to make certain \\nunwanted individuals do not come visiting - this \\nbestial state of mind is not the safest for \\nthose not of close kinship. The triangle shoul\\nd be painted in black, with blood-red lines \\naround the outside. This shape should be large enough for your body to fit in while sitting or upon all fours. Those not wan\\nting to paint up the floor - be\\ncause of carpetting or such - \\nmay wish to purchase a large piece of mate\\nrial and then paint the triangle upon it. \\nAt each point of the Triangle a red candle should\\n be placed. It is wise to prepare musick \\nwhich involves rapid beats - perhaps voudon inspired musick or rhythm based recordings. \\nA rather violent flavor should be present in the sounds which will pulsate through the air \\n\\nof the chamber.  The sorcerer\\n shall then paint u\\npon his body such sigils as represent the \\nbeast and its lunar nature. A sigil involving the combination of\\n sex - death - Moon - Birth \\nsign can be formed as one power-packed unit. \\nYour sight shall then\\n become much more \\nfocused,  everything transforming into \\na fire spiral of self realization. Clear your mind so it may enter \\ninto spheres of rapid and lustful inspiration. The red and \\nblack colors about your chamber should height\\nen the sense of the forces invoked. If you \\nare able to have assistance in this Lunar rite\\n, have the assistants sitting at opposite sides \\nof the Triangle with  you in \\nthe middle. The flames should \\nbe lit. The task of the \\nassistants is to carry your voice further into the astral plane, calling to the animal spirits \\nfrom which you came into flesh, hidden away\\n from the ages of growing humanity. \\nThe sigil should be consecrated in advance of the rite with sexual fluid, the result of focus \\nupon the object until climax. Once this is \\ndone, several drops of your own blood should \\nbe dropped on the center of the sigil. It is \\nrecommended that one does not think about the \\nsigil in the time period after the initial cons\\necration.   It should then sit for roughly 24 \\nhours before the actual rite. \\n Rite of the Werewolf  \\nThis rite is ideal for drawing in of energy \\nin its raw, physical form. The shadow shapes, \\nwhich will inhabit the se\\nlf and thus have their being, are \\nof your darkest de\\nsires, the gray \\nwolf of the subconscious made flesh. The finest\\n degree of control must be practiced, as \\nall is dependent on your indivi\\ndual strength. The sigil should be upon the altar which is \\nlocated near the triangle. If this is a solitary \\nrite, it is advised to \\nbegin a working of dream \\ncontrol shortly after. By this means the goal \\nof the rite may develop even further into \\natavistic exploration. You ma\\ny wish to devise a banishing ritual which suits your \\nworkings. Banishing rituals in Enochian are \\nmost useful, since this is an ancient and \\nbarbaric magickal language. Within its angeli\\nc alphabet are phonetic keys to the Aethyrs, \\n  121 121 to the evokation of spirits and \\nhigher sorcery.  A bani\\nshing ritual serves to clear the mind \\nof any non-magickal thoughts, a sort \\nof temporary \"exorcism\" if you will. \\n Invocation  RINMPS ZIPLL, VOVIM   LONDOH  MARB LEVANAEL, \\nRinmps Zipll, demonic element - Fire of Earth, Dragons\\' \\n\\nkingdom according to Levanael, \\n\\n OL  VINU A.   LAOAXRP, TORZUL  PAMBT OL \\nI invoke thee.      Laoaxrp, arise unto myself, \\n Strength stir  \\nUMPLIF LRING  MOSPLEH DSAAAI APATA. \\n\\nup the horns of Dsaaai Apata (Fire of Water element) \\n \\nFocus with intent upon the sigil, give it life by the inspiration glowing within every ounce of your individual being! It is most importa\\nnt that you understand \\neverything is possible \\nunto your own will. To begin to realize that \\neverything is basically a man-made lie, you \\nunderstand that all things are subject to cha\\nnge within your own personal world and that \\nwhich you choose to embark upon! EVERYT\\nHING IS POSSIBLE within ecstasy! \\nStimulation should occur until orgasm. While \\nmasturbating, focus upon this sigil and the \\nlife you are bringing forth merely by the choice \\nof will. Feel a beast rise within you, a \\nnew source of immense energy and excite\\nment is at your disposal. Upon climax, \\nvisualize the sigil in all ways and forget its purpose. It is at this point that all is possible \\n\\nbecause of pure will and focused intent. \\n\\n \\n \\nFocus now within this Triangle: \\n\\n \"Beast of the latent Aethyrs! \\nDemon of my darkest desires! \\n\\nAbiding within the forgotten caverns of the earth! \\nI give thee AWAKENING! \\n\\nI GIVE THEE MY OWN BEING! \\nMy extension, we are ONE! \\nBy the Blood Dripping Witch Moon I do invoke thee! \\n\\nMy form on the astral plane becomes this essence! \\n\\nBurning in the embers of life, Marchosias! \\n\\nWith me, thou art... oh Strength and Joy!!\" \\n \\nIt is of the first importance that you c\\nontrol your chanting. Even though it may be your \\nmost fervent desire to fully envelop yourself \\nin this psychodrama, it is most important for \\nthe dream working after that CONTROL is reta\\nined. When rites are planned as exercises \\nand battle awakenings, then one should indulge in full  psycho dramatic ecstasy. When \\n\\nhowever the will must stay intact to orches\\ntrate a pure state of modification - which will \\ncompensate for the sacrificed sexual re\\nlease - one must pay heed to control.   122 122 The musick within the chamber should drive \\none to a seeming frenzy, almost thrashing \\nmovements and animalistic passion enveloping \\nyou in abrupt, yet manageable spasms of \\nmovement. Lycanthropic nature derives from \\nthe most basic instin\\ncts of man™s bestial \\nancestors. The basis of human nature lives in\\n the caverns of the mi\\nnd, wherein all things secret constitute the light of \\ninspiration. This light is com\\nposed of many colors, and of \\nmany flames. \\n\\nKundalini (the Sacred Fire Serp\\nent, magickal Energy) should \\nbe fully awakened at this \\npoint, even after the sexual rel\\nease earlier. (A wonderful tant\\nric exercise is to control \\nstimulation after an actual orgasm. The purpose being to build up discipline which can \\n\\nstrengthen and further develop the will as it is). \\n\\nThe rite can also be performed with the pur\\npose of astral project\\nion, assuming the dream \\nflesh in its most bestial form. Suddenly hold \\nyourself still on all levels, do not move your \\nlimbs in a chaotic frenzy. Simply hold the self in check, allowing a strange sense of calm \\n\\nto overtake your rapid beating heart. Recite: \\n\\n \"It is my will to assume the dream flesh of the werewolf, \\n\\nin which I shall ascend and explore the night in its beauty!! \\nSo it is to be!\" \\n \\nOne should now burn the sigil of\\n desire, cast it to the nigh\\nt spirits and the Elementals \\nwhich you have created with pure desire and belief. Allow the circle around your being to send forth this now subconscious desire once \\nand for all. You must now forget it. All \\nreminders should fly with the smoke out of the window into the night sky. So mote it be... \\n\\nBanishing is the next step follo\\nwing the destruction of the sig\\nil. A banishing rite could be \\nmade up of hysterical laughter, in which the \\nmind is let loose on the conscious level from \\nfocus and consistent thought processes. When \\nlaughter occurs one is \\nas close as one can \\nbe  to the Death Posture on a conscious level. \\nOnce the banishing rite is complete, the sorc\\nerer should retire shortly after to bed. Upon \\nlaying down for the evening, focus your thoughts \\non rising and the thrill of shape shifting \\nand riding the night winds. Keep a detailed \\njourney of such dreams: it is recommended \\nthat you keep a journal near your bed in \\nwhich to write your dream experiences AS \\nSOON as you awake, this enables the brain \\nto keep higher awakening levels of memory \\nactive in the conscious. After several weeks \\nof doing this, you will be\\ngin to notice that \\nyour dreams are becoming more vivid. A vision \\nmay arise that provides a key for many \\n‚openings™. This is one such, if you will: \\n\\n \"The moon cast above us like the \\nmilking breast of a soothing \\nmother. \\nDripping honey and blood, the moon called to its fair children. \\n\\nA force we keep, a wild talon, within our latent memories... \\n\\nTo which all is possible in the passion of the hunt. \\nI felt my dream flesh, that which was electric... growing... \\n\\nrising... \\nA sigil before me, of deepest blue and crimson... \\n\\nBurning with the ambiguous wish of strength and desire! \\n  123 123 All was within my grasp, even the night wind, in phantom \\nsemblance. \\n\\nI felt alive and so fierce... lycanthropy so sweet in its rapture! \\n\\nFire grew within this shape I made, \\n\\nKnowing that fire was EVERYTHING within this sphere of \\n\\ndesire. \\nI rose and took towards the night sky, \\nSwooping down upon the forest lanes... \\nHearing further the three-fold cries of my kin, \\n\\nTo know voices backwards in the night \\nHow willing such passion, would beauty be so caring... \\n\\nSo deadly to those blind of will \\n\\nBlind of vision and waking dreams. \\n\\nI ran with the fury of the burning flame which drove me \\n\\nThe life itself in all control. \\n\\nBeneath a scarlet sky, in a seeming riverbed of black velvet, Giving once again the call to blood, \\nWhich by race memory is understood, \\n\\nAnd by the witch brood that dance with the spirit of night\"   Lycanthropy and Sigils  Those wishing to integrate sorcery into their da\\nily lives to a more viviid extent will find \\nsigils the most effective means of doing so  The following is an exercise based on \\n\\nlycanthropy and sigil recalling. If one is in need of strength or speed, stamina or \\n\\nnocturnal direction, I would suggest from pers\\nonal experience the use of sigils for calling \\nupon their lycanthropic spirit. If the individual ha\\ns practiced lycanthropy based in dream \\ncontrol and other such rites, then such an \\natavism will be more accessible to them as a \\nmagickian. The recommended working can be d\\none in several varied ways. Upon a piece \\nof scrap paper you  write a sentence encapsulating your desire. A sentence such as: \"I will obtain the instincts of a wolf\" \\nYou would the re write the words below by taking out various letters, the same way you \\n\\nconstructed the other sigils: (this is ONLY one method, by \\nway of example, and not \\nintended for copying, unless compatible \\nwith your alignment and ability.) \\n \"IW\\'LLTNNSICO\\'AWLF\"  One the flip side of the paper, re arrange the letters to form an interlocking symbol, where \\nthere is no recognition possible of\\n the original message of th\\ne letters. Once this is done, \\nfocus upon this intently for several moments,\\n memorizing each line and the sigil as a \\nwhole. If not using a sexual \\nstimulation technique, focus \\nmore upon the sigil and then \\nburn or tear it to pieces. Forget this sym\\nbol however still concentrate upon your will. \\nKeep you muscles tense and feel\\n the wolf take flesh. You s\\nhould then feel a strong and \\naggressive force within the center of your \\nbeing, act now upon this spirit which is so \\nmuch a part of you. Too many people forget \\nthe importance of studying and seeking to \\n  124 124 understand our shadow side, when one passes through the shadow self and delves into the depths of the subconscious you are acquiring ke\\nys to primal atavisms and latent powers \\nof the mind. These are just waiting to be \\nexercised, and are the fountainhead of much \\npractical magick. The key is in you hands\\n, after many years of relying upon society™s \\nmindless programming, whereby one loses \\nhope of discovering the true self.  Marchosias  Marchosias (2) is a Goetic daemon or Elementa\\nl  with whom I have worked for several \\nyears. This Elemental was discovered and \\ncharged back around 1997 during some of my \\nGoetic rituals in my old flat with my sist\\ner Shanna. I was working through a number of \\nElementals during those months and found th\\ne description of Marchosias to be most \\ncolorful to my individual taste. \\nI traced the sigil and gave a sacrifice of\\n blood and sexual fluid, the invocations were \\nrepeatedly sounded until I felt \\nthe surge of lycanthropic energy enrapture my very being! \\nThis demonic servitor, to whom I gave ne\\nw life, was now within me. I understood every \\nparticle of its essence. I felt \\nthe empathy between his nature \\nand mine. I have always been \\nclose to Lycanthropy, accepting and studying  my own animalistic desires, here was a \\n\\nspirit whose nature was precisely parallel. \\n\\nThere was a violent urge, such energy and pow\\ner! This charge of adrenaline is most \\nuseful at times of forth coming battle and se\\nlf defense. It is then that we are most \\ndangerous - especially those who study martia\\nl arts and control of muscle movements on \\nsmall, sensitive, levels. \\n\\nBlack robed, I began to sweat heavily within\\n the smoke filled chamber. The red candles \\nflickered at every movement I made, the \\natmosphere congealed, \\npulsating through with each heavy breath which I drew \\nlustfully into my body. My heart beat began to slow, my \\nsight was perfect - clear and \\ndefined - much more than nor\\nmal. My normal eyesight is \\n20/20, but this was an enhanced sight of \\nheightened senses, of passion and clear \\npredatory instincts. \\n\\nTracing the sigils in the air I found myself st\\nruggling to restrain \\nmyself from howling \\nfiercely within the closed chamber. I then \\nundertook by control of will to slow my heart \\nrate and focus well upon the demon sigil of\\n Marchosias. I was seeking a kind of \\nknowledge, of myself and this \\nspirit. Each Goetic demon Elemental serves well in \\ngranting knowledge and insight unto the sorcerer who would know him/her self. \\nAfter about what must have been fifteen mi\\nnutes, I performed the banishing rite and \\nfocused upon the small golden pentagram of  Solomon around my neck. The demonic \\n\\nstate of mind  left me a\\nnd I felt revitalized and strong \\nof mind and body. I packed away \\nmy temple items neatly, then took to a l\\nong and relaxing hike in the nearby fields, \\nenjoying the evening air and contemplating my thoughts. \\nLater that eve, before I reti\\nred I took down many notes fr\\nom my path working, opening \\nup many new avenues of exploration of my self\\n in its lunar aspect. \\nI have observed that \\neach time one discovers something significant \\nof your shadow side, you will also learn \\nsomething relevant to your day side self. This \\ncan be most helpful in your search for self \\npreservation in such situations as work, social relations, etc.    125 125 Chapter Five -Rites of Choronzon- \\nThe Vampyric Arts  Purpose and Meaning \\n The following rites and path workings deliver th\\ne soul into dire per\\nil. Choronzon (1) is \\nrepresented as many things, being a Vampire spir\\nit as well as the Guardian of the Abyss. \\nThe rites of Choronzon grant the sorcerer w\\nho can traverse such \\npaths a burning sphere of individual power, which may be used in such \\na way as to create and maintain a state of \\npersonal balance. However, these are by no me\\nans pointless \"black\" magick rites, they \\ndefine a moral code, that contains the black \\nand the white in integrated form. Black is \\nrepresented as hidden, of the shadow, secret and apart. White is the emanating power \\nwhich ascends from this \"shadow\" element. No\\n rite within this Grimoire is meant for \\n\"evil\" purposes or \"doing harm\"... they ar\\ne meant as a means of recovering and \\nreintegrating lost powers and abilities buri\\ned in the psyche. Th\\nis by a self-initiated \\nprocess of extreme sense reversion and expl\\noration. Choronzon is NOT meant to be in \\nany way worshiped or revelled \\nin. The point is to remain hidden and seek to understand \\nthis force of balance and destruction. Choronz\\non is between point A and point B, critical \\nto the crossing of the Abyss. He awaits an \\nopportunity to reverse th\\ne polarity of any life \\nforce within his orbit, which may result in ne\\nw life or in death, de\\npendent on the polarity \\nentering his sphere. Madness is the unbridled as\\npect of self-love, in which all becomes \\nnothing, and the familiar elements of individu\\nality are lost in a jumble of unlimited \\nintrospection. Between the paths of Hecat\\ne and Choronzon are shadowed forms where \\nthe witch will discover a mighty potential w\\nithin the self. In these moments all is \\nconnected in an instant of belief and desi\\nre. These spells are enveloping and their \\npotential is wide open, therein \\nthe sorcerer is able to adapt forms in accord with will. \\nThe tunnel wherein the beast is \\nawakened is the same as that\\n wherein the angel sings, the \\nunion is ineffable in its dual aspect of contro\\nl and panic. Pan lurks in every line of the \\nsong, in the Elysian fields where the breath of our spirit moves the gra\\nss. Possibility is the \\nexact purpose of life and discovery, the true\\n will speaks fluently in whispered, echoed \\ntones to those who listen. \\nIn performing the rites of Choronzon, the indi\\nvidual will face a plethora of night ghasts, \\nghouls and negative spirits, to \\nwhich WILL must speak if it\\n is to carry thee through. \\nThere is a language peculiar \\nto such demons, which the \\naspiring mind and will must \\nunderstand. Every voice has a hidden, reversed aspect which defines it in terms of \\n\\nimplicit possibilities. One should listen to \\nsuch voices carefully. Not necessarily to \\nbecome them but to go beyond them. \\n\\nThis Grimoire involves many things, all of\\n which are parallel. I do not recommend the \\nsorcerer to jump blindly into such rites.\\n The wizard who has a respect for nature and \\nhis/her own life will realize that the statement \"Nothing is True... Everything is \\nPermitted\" is most correct. Before you ope\\nn the gates of Choronzon and enter the \\nDa™athian Doorway, be sure of mind and sound in thought. \\n\\n   126 126  Evocation of Vampire Spirits   This is a method which involves the use of \\nyour blood for the evocation of an already \\nexistent vampire spirit. These beings can prove\\n to be more malicious\\n and dangerous than \\nmere servitors, as they alrea\\ndy have a partial will of their own. I have discovered, through numerous recording sessions involving EVP \\n(Electronic Voice Phenomena), that many \\nspirits will send half thought messages or\\n unintelligible rubbish. Though this could \\nperhaps partly be blamed on the method of\\n recording, involving capturing disembodied \\nvoices on magnetic tape, it is still something \\nto consider. A friend of mine gave an \\ninteresting opinion that, perhap\\ns because they are fragmented \\npartial identities, they will \\ngive any message to attract the attention of\\n the living. This makes \\nquite a lot of sense \\nespecially if you have worked\\n with EVP as much as I ha\\nve. When you do get messages, \\nthey may seem rather cryptic or \\'in code\\', \\nor differ little from the language of a bogus \\nSeance . For all these reasons, I would advise \\nbeing cautious with your\\n discoveries. I still \\ngive an attentive ear to such\\n phenomena, as I still find a certain excitement in capturing \\nthe dead on tape. I would suggest in such evo\\ncations that you make \\na recording just for \\nyour record and in case any useful or inspiring things \\'come through\\'. \\n \\nRequirements: \\n\\nA well developed protection ritual detaili\\nng power points of the body via the Chakras \\n(specific power points of the \\nbody), and created Elementals\\n especially for shielding \\neffects. \\n \\nThis is not a technique for the ill of sp\\nirit, since Qlipothic demons prey on such \\nweakness. Sexual services by va\\nmpire spirits can prove exciti\\nng and invigorating (as long as you are not their prey) but require much \\ncaution. Such beings, as I have mentioned \\nbefore, are notorious for i\\nnvoking obsession and later madness.\\n Sexual demons should be \\ntreated as nothing more than mere slaves\\n, otherwise they driv\\ne the unfortunate and \\nfoolish sorcerer into horrifying nightmar\\nes, exhaustion, paranoia, obsession and even \\nsuicide or a subconscious seed\\n-program invoking death. Once \\nthe Elemental is used and \\nthe purpose is served, banish as soon as po\\nssible. If evoking or creating a vampire \\nservitor spirit to destroy or carry out a cu\\nrse, employ a sacrifice \\nof your own blood, this \\ngives life force and binds the spirit to your will.\\n Such spirits are of significant use in such \\nworks, if charged with either fresh blood or\\n a sealed container \\nof old blood. The latter \\ngives a feeling of death and decay, due to\\n the decomposition and \\ncoagulation of the \\nblood. Such would prove helpful in revenge or defense evocations. \\n \\n The Death Posture \\n-Vampyric Inversion-  The Zos Kia Cultus often presents the Death Post\\nure as a \\'backwards\\' or \\'inverse\\' birth, by \\nwhich means the sorcerer assumes the God form\\n of Thanatos, as a glyph of the Cabalistic \\n  127 127 power zone of Da™ath. Knowledge of the da\\nrk or hidden resources\\n is present in the \\nannihilation of the self, which entails \\nunderstanding the clear and defined purpose of \\none™s individual genetic iden\\nity.  The correspondence between Da™ath and the Death \\nPosture lies with the nature \\nof the Death Posture as a \\nmethod. When one assumes the \\nDeath Posture then the mind is freed temporaril\\ny from the flesh. During this state the self \\nbecomes defined and opened at the same mome\\nnt at which the ego itself, composed of \\nthe current selve™s thoughts and ideals, is ‚v\\nacuumed™ in a dark vortex known as Da™ath. \\nJust as one reverses consci\\nousness, or returns ‚backwards™, to experience the cycle of \\ndeath and birth, so does the self enter into the more subconscious regions. \\nAs mentioned before Da™ath is the offs\\npring of Binah and Chokmah, Wisdom and \\nUnderstanding. Da™ath is Knowledge, in wh\\nich the self is stripped, and the entire \\nsubconscious is mapped out during an intense and \\necstatic state of self introspection. This \\nis therefore the very fountain head of self\\n power, by means of which a vast and arcane \\nlibrary is made available. Be cautious howev\\ner of the many Elementals, vampires and \\nother bestial haunters of the Abyss which w\\nill be within reaching distance. Know well \\nwhat you call! \\nThe Witch Cult in relation to the Witches \\nSabbat Craft opens the Da™athian Vampiric \\nCurrent thus becoming aligned with the black\\n or \\'hidden\\' essence of sorcery. By such \\nmeans dreams are gained, explored and - throu\\ngh vaulting into reality in the Day Side - \\nbecome flesh. The Witches Sabbat Craft can be \\nuseful in exploring the astral aspects of \\nvampirism, in which the sorcer\\ner shall taste from the cup of\\n Choronzon.  Lilith sprinkles \\nher powder of wolf and bat bl\\nood within the chalice which invariably leads to either \\nknowledge or madness. Lilith is\\n a representative of the night and therefore a connection \\nor  mirror of the Hebrew term LAYLAH (2\\n) H A L Y A L, meani\\nng night and death. \\nThrough the eye of Kia one is able to dive \\nthrough the black mirror,\\n wherein the Qlipoth \\ngrant the Grail of  Choronzon, \\nthe blood filled cup of vamp\\nire, incubi, succubi, ghouls \\nand ghosts. One must take care assuming the De\\nath Posture in the vampiric state due to \\nthe psychic and obsessive dange\\nrs and threats which can aris\\ne. The sorcer\\ner who would \\ndare sip from the cup of vampires must\\n first master the self on most levels. \\n \\n1) Ensuring balance and will is pr\\nesent in proper decision-making. \\n \\n2) A sense of inner strength mu\\nst be present in order to av\\noid the dangers of unbalanced \\nforces which exist in the astral Qlipoth. \\n\\n \\nDefense measures should be i\\nnvolved as well to ensure as\\n much resistance as possible \\nfrom astral vampire attacks. The symbolic re\\nference, of the vampire within the coffin or \\ntomb, is but an ideal image of the death of th\\ne mortal self, a one sided being based only in the Day Side; by which demise one™s own \\npersonal Daemon or Hidden Genius (Holy \\nGuardian Angel) shall manifest through the personality. \\n\\nThe Death Posture can be used vampirica\\nlly as the means of self-awakening through \\ninnate knowledge of the individual\\'s beast lik\\ne or atavistic nature. All proving useful in \\nthe areas of bestial or noct\\nurnal astral assumption. Thr\\nough the Death Posture one can \\nenter  Da™ath through Choronzon, the vampiric gu\\nardian which is regarded as a demon or \\nastral blood consumer. \\n\\n   128 128 Coven Maleficia  through numerous experime\\nnts has developed a method of absorbing \\nthe essence of a vampire sp\\nirit. This method involves th\\ne assumption of the Death \\nPosture and evoking the demon from the Qlipothic regions. The result often being \\n\\nsignificant in the development of inner know\\nledge gained via dream and later reality \\nthrough the flesh. I have found personally one \\nmust banish and exercise all means of \\nabsorbing such spirits, for one of a weaker \\nwill can fall prey to such psychic forces. A \\ndescription of the rite is as follows from\\n my personal magickal diary or \\'Book of \\nShadows\\' (Unpublished): \\n\\n\"I, Azyta Seker Arimanius and my partner, \\nAswad Najm al Din constructed a 6 foot \\ncoffin which was painted black. Upon the coffin \\nwas painted a silver image of the lord of \\nthe Crossroads, being in Voudoo tradition Ba\\nron Carrefour which is\\n associated with \\nChoronzon in it\\'s masculine aspect. Such symbols as the Eye and the Hand representing \\n\\nthe  Zos and Kia were painted as well. The \\ncoffin was consecrated and upon it was placed \\na skull with both the sigil of Black Eagle and \\nthe symbol of the Crossroads or the Twins \\nwithin the Voudoo tradition. A ci\\nrcle was inscribed in black with the names of power \\nLAYLAH, LILITH, HECATE, CHORONZON a\\nnd THANATOS in red. Candles of both \\ncolors were placed outside each name inscribe\\nd on the outer rim of the circle. A triangle \\nwith an Eye representing Kia was painted in indigo at the center, to hold the spirit which \\n\\nwas to be evoked. We had at hand a vial co\\nntaining aged blood (my own) which is used \\nfor the evocation of vampire \\nspirits. The blood, even though seal\\ned is depleted of oxygen \\nand therefore has a strong odor of death. Th\\ne use of aged blood is based on the \\nassumption that as blood if li\\nving is useful for the evoca\\ntion of spirits, \\nthen aged blood, \\nwhich carries a strong odor of death is usef\\nul for the summoning of\\n vampire or negative \\nspirits. The significance of such\\n a rite is to obtain a glyph\\n of knowledge which will often \\nmanifest via dream revealing the essence, construction and ultimately the development of \\n\\nVampiric Elementals. I had painted in red \\nupon my chest and face symbols of Vampiric \\nand Da™athian spirits and tunnels, by which the Qlipoth were evoked. Soror Davcina acted as a scribe and channeli\\nng point of the rite, \\nwho would preside over the assumption of the Death Posture in the inst\\nance of control being lost by myself. While \\nmy evocations were  intoned her chant was as follows: \\n \"Witch-Moon of Blood, Eye of Hecate, \\n\\nChoronzon shall send forth thy night spirit through the Qlipoth... Move, Appear!\"  \\nThis was repeated throughout my incantations as follows: \\n \\nOpening and banishing rituals, the casting of\\n the circle followed by dancing Widdershins \\n(counter-clockwise) around the circle.  \\nThe Enochian call of the Seventh Aethyr (S\\nee the Vision and the Voice, by Aleister \\nCrowley, published by Weiser) At this time I ope\\nned the top of the blood vial and poured \\nmost of the contents within th\\ne circle, forming as best  I co\\nuld the sigil wh\\nich represented the vampire spirit. \\n\\n    129 129 Invocation of Vampiric Elementals:  \"Of the Qlipoth you are bred, to \\nwhich the cup of Dragons blood \\nis filled \\n\\nMother of Abominations, w\\nhose mighty title is QOPH: \\nI evoke thee through this circle, \\nguarded by the sacred names of \\nShaitan \\nby which the Caverns of Da™ath shall be opened \\nMove and appear within this circle, \\nso that thou can be within this sacred space \\n \\nNo harm shall come to us for our rite is sacred under the sign of \\n\\nCarrefour; \\nBlack Witch Mother of blood giving life \\n\\nOf Night Bane and the Moths of the hidden space, \\n\\nI evoke thy specter to this circle.\"  \\nMy evocations led up to a powerful in\\ntonation, at which I FELT Kundalini rising  \\nthrough my spine. An aura of great strength \\nvisible as an outline \\nof red light surrounding \\nme emanated through my being and was obser\\nved by Soror Davcina. So much may be \\nexpected by those who would use such evoc\\nations from the very heart of night. The \\natmosphere of the chamber became rather hum\\nid and heavy,  so much so that sweat \\nbegan to form upon my forehead. I felt I was ready to assume the Death Posture, to \\n\\nperform which I bent my body over towards my legs and began breathing at a deep and \\n\\nrapid rate, exhaling until I felt a dizziness take my mind. \\nAs I regained my standing position Soror Da\\nvcina took both her hands and with a firm \\nand steady grip squeezed my throat until I lost \\nconsciousness. I later learned from her that \\nI had fallen within the entrance of the circle, and she was careful not to let me fall hard, \\n\\nland on a candle or injure my head. At the \\nmoment of assuming the Death Posture I had \\nfelt a rush of red energy, followed by what se\\nemed to be a spiraling ecstasy of phantom \\nenergies within my mind. All conceived dogm\\na was now destroyed. There is much that \\ncan be said regarding that \\nexact moment, for the self  becomes nothing yet open to all \\npossibilities. They took the form of many sh\\napes and faces, while I felt the up rush of \\nweightlessness and perceived a cloud of various spirits and \\nenergies. I opened my eyes \\nand felt a source of strength which I had not fe\\nlt before with the Death Posture. All time \\nseemed to be transcended in the moments that \\nI stared facing the coffin at the head of the \\ncircle. I regained my stance only now within \\nthe very circle within which I had evoked \\nthe vampire spirit. Soror Davcina had placed  \\noutside of the circle a further invocation \\nwhich I would now intone: \\n \"Choronzon, I invoke thee! \\nThe wisdom of Da™ath is the wisdom of the Death Posture! By bat and wolf blood I become, \\n\\nSacred to Lilith the Mother of Night \\n\\n \\nChoronzon, thy madness shall not take me \\n  130 130 but the strength and glory of my \\nHoly Guardian Angel shall uplift \\nI am born of fire and blood \\n\\nof which by Night I take my fill!\" \\n \\n \\nWe then closed the circle and banished. \\n \\nMy dreams that evening were of flying and of\\n feasting, of shapes \\nwhich burned in black \\nand crimson. I obtained further impetus towards \\n vampiric evocation, \\'to call them forth\\' \\nas it were. My instinct was \\nto wait and meditate upon the or\\nacle. Due to the necessity of \\nworking in a positive and progressive way, a\\nvoiding the turn towards black (seeking the \\nGRAY path, of balance) it is \\nalways highly important that th\\ne sorcerer decides which is \\nthe best to do. Such demonic Elementals must \\nof their nature desire to become flesh, and \\nmay possess living bodies,  but I know I successfully absorbed the Elemental. I would \\n\\nhowever recommend that only an adept in such\\n arts attempt such an act, since it CAN \\nlead to madness if the will and mind are not strong. \\n\\n \\n Vampiric Servitors - Incubus - Succubus -  Vampiric servitors can prove useful in the \\nevocation and creation of Elementals, either \\nfor the purpose of defense or as ‚fetish im\\nps™. One particular method, which can prove \\nuseful in times of psychic war between two \\nsorcerers, involves th\\ne creation of several \\nservitors where each serves a different purpose. I have found such Elementals are \\n\\nwonderful for a short evening of  dreams \\nand waking, however beyond that would prove \\nrather dangerous, even to the point of obsessi\\non. Such spirits should be controlled by the \\nsorcerer, not the other way around which often befalls unbalanced magickians. The \\nwizard realizes that servitors are only in \\nexistence to serve the will of the Warlock \\nhimself, and that they should be banished a\\nnd reabsorbed once their purpose is served.  \\nIncubi/Succubi have long been\\n connected with vampires. The reason for this is their \\ndraining power during the dreams in which th\\ney stalk. These demons enter the dreaming \\nmind of the victim and slowly drain them of\\n Chi or Astral Blood while sexually exciting \\nthem. Such beings can prove useful if proper \\ndefenses are secured, or may be directed at \\nanother. It is even possible for the sorcerer\\n to take the flesh of the incubi-succubi \\ndepending on their long term plans. For an \\nextended attack, for which the sorcerer is \\nindisposed, it is recommended to create a servitor for the purpose of longevity.  \\n Incubus  \\nMale demons who would enter the dream of\\n sleeping women or men, seduce them by \\ntaking the flesh of their desire. The demon then\\n drains them of astral blood while sexual \\ncongress takes place in the dreaming state, l\\neaving the victim not only drained of energy \\nbut open to obsession and later personal destru\\nction. Such spirits are known in folklore \\n  131 131 around the world, primarily in Europe, to seduc\\ne their victims and drain them not only of \\ntheir astral energy but semen as well. The \\npoint of this was to\\n create other demon \\nservitors and offspring. \\n Succubus Female demons, born of the essence of Li\\nlith, goddess of the night. These female \\nservitors work in the same fashion, taking on \\nthe flesh of the individuals deep set sexual \\ndesires. The Succubi will seduce and drai\\nn their victims each night until exceeding \\nexhaustion causes some form of self- destru\\nction, which almost i\\nnvariably causes the \\nvictim to be absorbed ps\\nychically by the Succubi. By re-absorbing the demon, the \\nsorcerer can therefore gain new astral st\\nrength by taking what the succubi has drained \\nitself. Whether the demon is an Incubus or \\nSuccubus is realatively unimportant, but the \\ngender of the magician involves some practical\\n dangers. I have seen more destruction to \\nmale magicians, this is due to the fact that males tend to be more gullible on the sexual \\n\\nlevel, more apt for dangerous sexual enc\\nounters. Please understand however I am not \\nstating this is always the case, just more \\nfrequent in my personal experience. For this \\nreason I will always suggest that the male sor\\ncerer trains with an emphasis on discipline \\non the sexual level, to avoid \\nunwelcome situations. The same applies to females if they \\nharbor similar weaknesses. \\n\\n Attacks A vampiric servitor can be \\na significant weapon (just as \\nany properly charged Elemental \\nwould be) if used correctly. Stealth should be \\ninstilled within such \\nElementals during the \\ncreation rite. For instance, if one is to at\\ntack an enemy who is famous for his sexual \\nattraction to a particular sex, ei\\nther male or female, then the appropriate servitor should \\nbe created. If the enemy desi\\nres females then the sorcerer\\n would create his/her own \\npersonal formula for creating a succubi. Such can be done with a sigil being drawn \\nrepresenting the attributes for the servitor, \\nalso a mental images and various elements \\nthey can be drawn from, being water or fire, \\netc. The sigil would be a channel for creating \\nthrough sexual fluid or in defense or str\\nong attacks your own blood. Once the servitor is \\ncreated you should offer no more fluid, le\\nst you become a victim yourself. Several \\nservitors can be created for the same intende\\nd victim depending on the methods of attack. \\n Defense Servitors can be utilized for positive purpos\\nes also, such as defensive measures. The \\nindividual could have as many as they \\nwish, although I only suggest one with the \\nmaximum of two. The Warlock who would work \\nwith such forces should already have \\ndeveloped a powerful psychic defense, built up \\nby continuous will training and discipline \\nexercises. One may develop such strength by \\nyoga and the various \\ndisciplines, building \\nup an effective wall of mental strength wh\\nich would be psychica\\nlly invigorated by \\nmagical processes. The result would be a \\nmagickal wall which could deflect such \\npsychic/astral attacks. Such Wa\\nlls could also be utilized to reflect a hostile offensive back \\nupon the attacker. \\n    132 132 Vampire Servitor Creation Rites  An evocation and creation of a vampire se\\nrvitor for the use of sexual workings. A sigil should be constructed to fit an image that is desireable and pleasing to you.   133 133 Once it is constructed, change \\nthe room to fit the atmosphere\\n you are looking for, such as \\ncandle lit, billows of incense smoke and im\\nages of succubi or incubi upon your walls. \\nOnce the sigil is made, you will\\n want to consecrate it. I \\nrecommend a mental envisioning \\nduring masturbation until you fully develop th\\ne demon you are creating... grant it every \\nfeature which you find attractive, including the not so attracti\\nve features, like the slight \\nimperfections which would still \\nactively excite you.  Remember\\n, this servitor is for your \\nuse so every desire should be formed within\\n it. This is where the possibility of danger \\nwill come in, due to the fact that this creatu\\nre is a creation of your\\n own individual desire, \\nwhich you are giving birth and form which thro\\nugh dreams shall become flesh. The Id is \\ngiven power by charging the sigil with your sexual fluid, if possible covering the sigil. The succubi/incubi will then manifest in dr\\neams and it shall be so very real to you. \\nReality is yours to shape, however take care that you do not enter the essence of \\n\\nChoronzon and become prey. To destroy and re\\n - absorb the Elemental, one should focus \\nupon the destruction of the sig\\nil, the object  which the serv\\nitor was bound to, then at the \\nheight of the focus, burn the sigil over a ritu\\nal fire and forget the image. You will have \\nthen re-absorbed the demon and it shall return to nullity. \\n \\nA ritual for the creation of protective vampiric servitor - For use in absorbing or \\n\\ndeflecting Astral - Psychic attacks  A vamp\\niric Elemental created for the purpose of \\nabsorbing astral attacks or deflecting them can\\n be most appropriate if one is planning a \\nswift and effective defense against some one\\n who is planning a malicious battle. This \\nspell is also useful for thos\\ne ladies who may be viewed as\\n psychic prey for chauvinist \\nmales who feel they can be intimidating by \\nthrowing some useless wanks their way.  \\nServitors should not be created to compensate for mental weakness, such beings would be \\nmore of a complication in your life. \\nPlease remember that the most deadly and effec\\ntive attack is the swiftest and most silent. \\nLet your enemies be fooled by appearance. This \\nis the key to mistakes made on the part \\nof the aggressor. Underestimate nothing, face \\nit as the most significant enemy with the \\nmost knowledge of the art of \\nattack. This is how you should \\ntrain yourself, be quick and \\nbe alert. If you are slow you \\nshould learn the most powerfu\\nl blow possible and how to \\neffectively apply it. If you are quick you should \\nlearn the fastest and most precise attacks \\nto make way for a short ending. Battles, either \\nphysical or on the as\\ntral plane should be \\nthe shortest possible, before strength and \\nstamina are lost. Mistakes and misplays are \\nmade more possible over the course of extended time. Humans as a race are always \\n\\nfallible, this is inherent not only in humans \\nbut also in every living organism. Know and \\nunderstand this and you shall  be a nightmare to your enemies. \\n\\n Creation Rite of Servitors for Defense \\n A sigil should be constructed representing \\nthe particular spirit you have in mind. Once \\nthe sigil is constructed, it \\nshould be consecrated with bl\\nood and sexual fluid, giving the spirit the most possible to grow upon. Once you \\nhave consecrated it, intone to yourself:  \"Servitor __________, I charge thee \\nwith life to defend my being \\nin the way of _________\". \\n   134 134 The beings generally grow in\\n dreams once this is done. Often, a magician will create two \\nfor the purpose of defense in times of battle. When charging the sigil, one should focus \\n\\nupon things which activate a strong \\nsense of  mind, such as armor,  fire arms, etc.  Such \\nstrengths are built in the mind \\nand the servitor is only as\\n strong as the sorcerer who \\ncreates it. To banish the servitor, banish and \\nre - absorb the spirit\\n by the same means as \\ncreating it. \\n \\n Spirits Born of Blood \\n \\nThe vampire spirit which can be trapped and absorbed is often an imposing or seemingly \\n\\nuncontrollable force which can cause psychic da\\nmage and eventually physical wear and \\ntear to the self if permitted to \\ngrow stronger. This type of so\\nrcery, that of trapping spirits \\nis derived from Petro or Fire Voudoo, which ra\\nises the question of \\nblack magick. Morals \\nbeyond the oath of the magickian are not of ge\\nneral interest to me, however the question \\nof strength and diligenc\\ne is. Vampire spirits can prove significant as servitors, either  as \\ndefense guardians or dream predators who \\ncan invariably destroy your enemy within \\nweeks. It would be recommended however that\\n one should seek any other means before \\nworking death magick on a victim. If the situatio\\nn can be avoided it is\\n often the path one \\nshould take, especially if two can \\'talk it over\\'\\n or just \\'go your seperate ways\\'. Anger is \\nnot a means of control, one should have time \\nto calm down before such plans are worked \\nunless there is no other possible choice.  \\nDreams are a vital source of psychic and ment\\nal resurgence, by which one can repair the \\nself and grow in the state of understanding, compassion, mental strength and the like. The \\nflip side of the absorption of \\nsuch a spirit is that if not properly prepared, or merely \\nattempted with the spirit es\\ncaping one could risk possession, psychic damage or madness. \\nSuch beings generally are mindless, especially\\n if broken fragments of\\n a former self;  but \\nsome may be of extra terres\\ntrial (non human) origin, or a \\npowerful sorcerer suriving \\nintact in the discarnate state, these have ex\\ntensive abilities upon the astral plane. This is \\nalso true of the adept sorcerer\\n who is able to take on the \\ndream flesh of the vampire, it \\nwill prove nearly impossible for anyone to abso\\nrb such a sorcerer\\'s spirit. Such results \\nrequire close to the same expenditure in time, and semi continuous work, as destroying a \\n\\nspirit to take command of a body. Such is \\npossible, but most da\\nngerous and difficult, \\nespecially if the original spirit has a host of \\nfamiliars, servitors or \\'Black Iron Walls\\' with  \\nresulting psychic dangers for the operator. \\nI have made mention of the t\\nechnique of binding a \\nspirit to a sigil \\ncovered in blood and \\nsexual fluid. For the next step,  involving mo\\nre powerful servitors,  would be one bound \\nto human blood from your body and sealed in \\na vial or jar with associated herbs and \\npotions. If one is creating a se\\nrvitor through a sigil it would then be the ne\\nxt step to bind \\nthem to a jar filled with your blood and \\na small amount of water. This would mean \\nsubmerging the sigil and actuall\\ny sealing it in the jar or vi\\nal. Eldritch horrors of the \\nLovecraftian type are often br\\nought this material plane by \\nevoking and storing such in \\ncontainers. If such is done and later buried in\\n a plot of land it is not uncommon to begin \\nexperiencing hauntings and distur\\nbances in the area. It is rather tricky however to banish \\nand re-absorb such a spirit, one must firs\\nt perform  several powerful absorbing and \\n  135 135 banishing rites, which are listed here. Thes\\ne can of course be changed according to the \\nstyle of the sorcerer \\nbut the basis is here.   Evoking and Binding  A circle and a triangle should be drawn upon th\\ne floor or ground. The name of the spirit, \\nwhether created (if one used \\nthe original evoking method by \\nsigil and blood/sexual fluid) or already known should be written within th\\ne circle itself. Appropr\\niate references and \\nsystems should be consulted within the Goe\\ntia, for which this very method derives.The \\nspirit shall now be evoked. I will put it in the \\ncontext of the spirit already existing,  since \\nthe first part of the rite dealt with actually creating it. \\n\\n The Evocation  \\nSprinkle drops of blood within the triangl\\ne and pace widdershins around it, focusing upon \\nthe nature of the vampire spir\\nit you are evoking. An Enochian\\n key or call to Aethyr is \\nrecommended. \\n\\n \"I hereby evoke thee, oh spir\\nit __________, to act as a guide \\ntowards the shadows of the unsee\\nn. Come and be greeted with \\nmuch thanks and regard for your very essence, I seek to give a \\n\\nmaterial vessel. \\n\\nBy the spirit of Lilith and of Cain, of which blood you are born \\n\\nAnd by the Dragon which you serve: Night haunt vampire spirit \\nof Belial, \\nfrom whose domain your spirit is guided by the wolves \\n\\nFrom regions unspoken and grave co\\nld I evoke thee\\n into this \\ncircle \\nCome within and manifest w\\nithin the sigil I have made \\nSamael and Asmodeus, to encircle my belief, \\n\\nYour essence is of night bane and cloven hoof \\nUpon the wings of the bat ye shall ride \\nCome quickly and without delay \\n\\nTo act as a guide for my actions \\n\\nMy will ye shall obey \\n\\nuntil the service is complete \\n\\nI pay you with the blood I spill \\nMy own essence given as sacrifice \\nto confirm my Will for this act \\n\\nI evoke thee!\"  \\n The Binding    136 136 Place the vial or jar within the circle, it s\\nhould have already been filled with whatever \\namount of your blood you are using, so that th\\ne composition is already taking the form of \\ndeath. Fresh blood is often used for evocati\\non or calling, however the binding can be of \\nold blood. Place the sigil within the vial \\nor vessel until submer\\nged in the elixir.  \\n\"Spirit ____________, I now grant th\\nee the sanctuary of this \\nvessel \\nYou are now bound to this vial for the duration of the time \\n\\nneeded, \\nto be released by me  when thy task is complete. \\n\\nThis is the price of the blood and life I have given \\nI bind you in the name of your father, Belial \\n\\nIn the name of your Mother Lilith \\n\\nIn the name of your kin, Cain. \\n\\nSo it is done\"  \\nSeal now the jar and banish. \\nThe spirit shall now be at your disposal, so \\nbe careful in your commands. Such works of \\nblack magick for the use of terror or the abus\\ne of terror can invoke pa\\nin or destruction of \\nthe self. \\n\\n Banishing \\n \\nOnce the demon has served the purpose, it should\\n then be set free or\\n re-absorbed. If you \\ndid not create it, do not attempt to absorb it,  fo\\nr the results could be disastrous at the best. \\nSuch demons are generally eldritch creature\\ns waiting for the chance of absorbing human \\nlife force on the astral plane. Break\\n now the bottle within the triangle. \\nIntone: \\n \"I now free thee, Spirit ______________, your freedom is \\n\\ngranted for my word is true. Return without issue to whence you \\n\\ncame, serve me no longer for th\\nere is no obligation once the \\npurpose is met. I have given \\nyou blood and bound you, life force \\nwas granted. In return you have\\n sufficiently met the goal of the \\nevocation. Go forth now and harm\\n no one, for your manifestation \\nis over. So mote it be!\" \\n  \\nBanish and forget. \\n \\nI recommend that the sorcerer takes a death \\nfigure form, such as Kali, the robed figure \\nAnkou, Saturn, Anubis, Cronos, etc. \\n To Absorb \\n \"I have given you life and now I shall take it away.   137 137 All was possible through my W\\nill just as I shall feast upon thy essence. \\nThis is my natural rite and will. \\n\\nReturn to my shadows and become NOT. \\n\\nSo mote it be\" \\n\\n  \\nEnter the circle of evocation and work yourself into a steady and controlling focus on \\n\\nabsorbing the spirit. Breathe \\ndeeply until exhaustion and sl\\nowly regain your composure. \\nClose the circle and banish fully. \\n \\n Dream Haunting  \\nOnce the tables of magickal combat are tu\\nrned towards you and there is no conceivable \\nchance of avoiding it, then you must turn your\\n will towards the utter destruction of the \\nenemy. If there is no other way then one should \\nnot hold any feelings of\\n guilt or remorse. \\nWhen there is a chance or way to avoid such me\\nans, one should not be reluctant to take it. Have diligence and respect for your indivi\\ndual self and the power you may hold. Please \\nknow as well that all \\nthings are possible a\\nnd that just because you have begun a climb \\ntowards magickal power and your potential, al\\nways know that compar\\ned to the universe \\nin which we exist we are nothing and in most \\ncases to nothing we return.  By holding life \\nin respect, and developing the ability to act \\nwith caution and maturity one will continue to \\ngrow in psychic and physical \\npower. It is only when\\n the sorcerer overrat\\nes the self by the \\ninflation of ego that weakness will set in \\nand leave the in\\ndividual weak of spirit and \\nstrength. Illusion is the ultimate enemy. Th\\ne same can be said  for ego. The methods \\nwhich Aleister Crowley expl\\nored are based on going beyond \\nand above the ego, by the \\ntaking of god forms and yoga techniques whic\\nh further teach the limits of the mind and \\nbody. A significant method of weighing down a\\nnd troubling the mind, in order to weaken \\nthe opponent, is to stalk them through dreams. This can be done by actually taking the \\n\\nvampire flesh in your dreams or sending an El\\nemental/servitor to haunt them repeatedly. \\nThe vampire spirit will often connect within \\ntheir dreams and begin to\\n activate disturbing \\nthoughts on the dream level until paranoia sets in\\n. This could manifest\\n in various ways, \\nthe intended victim could actually feel chased or even see the spirit which may assume \\n\\nthe shape that fits the victims own psychic te\\nrror. Remember in dreams we can shift flesh \\ninto any form desirable unto the self, so it is \\nwith the receptor of the haunting. This is the \\ndanger of the knowledge of the Kia and it\\'s ma\\nnifestations. The spirit should be created \\nby Vampiric Servitor techniques, of blood a\\nnd semen and should be focused upon before \\nsleep. The sorcerer should be sure of the in\\ntended victim and hold a \\nclear vision in their \\nmind of how the servitor is to\\n act. Once this is done then \\nthe magickian should retire to \\nsleep and by doing such will send the Elemental in the form of a night haunt towards it\\'s \\n\\nvictim in the dream.  Such methods require\\n an advanced degree of development and \\nshould only be attempted by those who have ha\\nd significant experience and practice in \\nthe matter of creating and/or evoking servitors. \\n\\n \\n   138 138   \\n \\n Nature is More Atrocious \\n-Sex Magick- The Birth of a Lunar Intelligence \\n WARNING\\n: Caution should be exercised with this rite\\n. The creation of a moon child on the astral \\nplane is sometimes more dangerous than gi\\nving it flesh in the womb. The reason it is \\ndangerous is that it is yet another ‚step up™ from any normal Elemental, in simple terms it \\n\\nis the closest to human intelligence that one \\ncould create, it stands on the threshold of \\nhaving it™s own will. The other point to understand\\n is that such servitors, due to their lack \\nof will, act only unto your commands. If one \\nfalls prey to starting to communicate with \\nthem when unnecessary then obsession can oc\\ncur. The Elemental will gain immortality \\nthrough your soul itself, it will become a\\nttached and there is little hope beyond that. The same is the case with any of the vampiric rites included in this Grimoire, if not \\n\\nundertaken properly there is literally ‚hell to pay™. The Sorcerer who takes on the act of sex to\\n invigorate what Aleister Crowley called a \\nMoonchild is stepping beyond the boundaries\\n of control and opening the gates of \\nsomething else.  I have stressed extreme disc\\nipline in dealing with such spirits and would \\nsay only the most advanced should undertake such\\n a working as this. The contents of this \\nworking is based upon an Astral Moonspirit, not\\n a baby conceived in the flesh (which is \\nby all means possible). The Automata formed \\nthrough your sex and the spirit formed in \\nyour astral semen will give life to this sorcery.\\n Rituals such as this have long been hidden \\nfrom the public and from most occultists. This\\n is due to the fact that such workings \\ninvoke bestial and demonic incarnations, like\\n flesh taking atavisms which would drive \\none to the brink of madness and death. The pr\\nimal stygian daemons \\nwho stand waiting at \\nthe threshold are going to run \\nthrough the gate fi\\nnally and I can only hope that the couple \\nwho undertake this rite are willing to reap th\\ne consequences of such\\n an undertaking. This \\nis Black Magick in every sense of the wor\\nd, it creates or evokes an\\n offspring of your \\nsorcery. \\nThe spirit is first given essence through the desire and will of the couple. Energy is fed to \\n\\nit by belief and the blood offering. This is obt\\nained from the workers themselves several \\ndays before and fed into a ja\\nr, so that the blood may coa\\ngulate. The blood given would \\ngive the entity initial substance, while the in\\ntercourse and sexual energy within the circle \\ngive it further energy; growing with the \\nbuildng intensity of the sexual act. At the \\nmoment of ejaculation the spir\\nit is given life through the se\\nmen itself, giving it astral \\nsubstance and form. Be sure to have your pur\\npose for it clear and defined, be willing to \\ndestroy and absorb it once the \\ngoal of your desire is obtaine\\nd. Some horrifying prospects \\ninclude the initial astral forma\\ntion with a sigil, and then la\\nter during a similar black rite \\nthrough natural congress impregnating the wo\\nman and drawing the moonspirit into the \\nEmbryo, giving it a further strength of spirit wh\\nich could in time and growth as a child \\nform a strong will. \\n  139 139 Those who would actually desire to form \\na moon spirit into a baby through natural \\ncongress would proceed with the same invo\\ncations, forming a spirit net which would \\nseize the evoked daemon. At the moment of \\nejaculation, with the man ejaculating within \\nthe woman the spirit should be drawn with\\nin the body of the woman until the egg is \\nfertilized. If the woman is not pregnant so\\nme days after the Elemental will either \\ndissipate or be absorbed by the fema\\nle during a later banishing ritual. \\nThe sorcerer MUST reach into another reality du\\nring this rite, another dimension if it is to \\nbe successful. At the moment of orgasm or \\nundertaking the Death Posture a clear vision of the spirit must be formulated, clearly seen\\n and projected into the \\nastral, thus giving it \\nclear life through Will, Desire and Belief. This \\nrite is in honor of Hecate, Lilith, Kali and \\nBabalon, a primal reaching towards the Goddess. \\n\\n \\nPreparations: \\n\\n \\nA sigil, being a doll \\nin this case, should \\nbe created and given the powers you wish the \\nElemental to possess. Paint or etch symbols a\\nnd attributes you wish this spirit to possess, \\nso that it can better complete its task. \\n\\nA circle large enough to hold two people lying \\non their backs in natural congress, and a \\ntriangle within the circle (to be under the \\ncouple) in which the evoked Elemental shall \\nreside during the rite. The si\\ngil should be within the circ\\nle as well as blood from the \\ncouple, stored well in a jar and enough for pouri\\nng twice. Do not harm one animal in this \\nworking, it is of utmost importance to give\\n the lunar intelligenc\\ne birth and connection through your own blood, to prevent the spir\\nit from obtaining  de\\nsires alien to your \\npurpose. \\nThe circle should be inscribed with the names: LILITH - HECATE - KALI - BABALON \\nA dagger and sword should be present as well \\nas the Chalice. Salt \\nshould be formed in a \\ncircle around the invocation area, to ensure\\n no escape for the spirit. Red and Purple \\ncandles should be placed around the circle as well. \\n \\nWarlock: (Holding Athame) \\n\\n ﬁElder Gods of Stellar Forces, \\nI invoke a great Dragon Burning \\nwith the fires of Mars within my very body, prepare me for the \\n\\npurity of this work. Witches \\nSabbat Goat, God of Life and \\nEnergy, brother of PAN...

I invoke you through Blood, Move and appear \\n\\nunto this circle, enter our bodies and celebrate our union!ﬂ    140 140 Warlock: (Blood carefully poured around the doll-sigil) \\n ﬁAz-Lilith, great manifestation \\nof Tiamat and Babalon - The \\nforce of your burning essence enfl\\names our very being, hold now \\nthe spirit which we callﬂ \\n\\n \\nBlood now poured within triangle\\n, giving material basis for \\nconception on the astral plane. \\n \\nWitch: \\nﬁBy blood, by life-spirit of our desi\\nre form now. From the great \\nArena of Anon take thou flesh, for the purpose \\n\\nof_____________.ﬂ \\n Couple shall now copulate intently while focusing upon the mental image, the sigil itself. \\nThe Woman should initially be atop the male\\n, symbolizing Lilith and the balance of \\nmasculine and feminine energy. This also repr\\nesents Lilith when she wished to ride \\nAdam and he refused, the Warlock is acknowle\\ndging feminine strengt\\nh and balance. The \\nobvious subversive symbol being the Lunar Aspect of the self. Once the orgasm is obtained for both. (Femal\\ne first and male last) the male should \\nejaculate upon the sigil itself. The alternate me\\nthod is for the male to ejaculate within the \\nfemale (with of course the obvious possible \\nconsequences) and then she would put the \\nsigil to her vagina or squat \\nover it and let it drip out, both fl\\nuids together, giving life to \\nthe Elemental. Once the orgasm is complete \\nthe more psychic of the two should assume \\nthe Death Posture while intently visualizi\\nng the moonspirit. There is a reaching beyond, \\nwhen the focus of the individual becomes ab\\nsorbed and the belief becomes flesh. The \\nElemental is then itself born \\nof astral semen.The remaining amount of blood should be \\npoured upon the sigil covering \\nthe sexual fluid. Announce the purpose of the Elemental, \\nand place it within a small box. Banish any \\nremaining energies that may have been \\nevoked and then rest. \\nWatch all your desires become flesh, but be\\nware the consequences of your workings... \\nsomething is watching. \\n\\n \\n Towards the Vampyric Godhead A Calling to Choronzon, Guardian of the Abyss   \\nOne of the most significant rites of evocation \\nOR invocation within this Grimoire is the \\nrite of Choronzon, being the cal\\nling of the multiple vampiric energy currents of that \\nwhich we call Choronzon. Numerous occultists \\nhave sought to control this  source of \\nenergy, called the Guardian of the Abyss and \\nmadness incarnate, none have defined this \\nrather formless source of energy as positive. \\nAll vampiric desires, being based in the \\nsubconscious are offspring of Choronzon, being \\ndual natured and energy consuming Elementals. \\nThis ritual is a diving into the Abyss, \\nthere to be confronted by Choronzon itself.\\n Such a demon can manifest in numerous \\n  141 141 ways, depending upon your subcons\\ncious, will and own individual fears. The mind is \\nrevealed to this Guardian, thus delivering the \\nwould be vampire into a test of will, in a \\nstate of total vulnerability. If the will and in\\ntent is not pure madness \\nwill occur, the same \\nas with what is known as vampiric obse\\nssion. The adept becomes \\ndrunk on the blood of \\nthe Mother of Abominations (the Black aspe\\nct of Babalon, as well as Kali). They reach \\nthe destruction point of thei\\nr own essence and thus become trapped within the Abyss. \\nSuch deformed desires are in fact what ha\\ns been the building of the Qlipoth, for it  \\nharbors unbalanced energies and Elementals\\n. The body in this case would continue but \\nthe very essence of the individual woul\\nd be gone, rendering him or her into an \\nunmotivated state of \\' just existing\\'. \\n\\nThis rite involves three or \\nmore sorcerers, two of whom should be robed in Crimson who \\nact as the assistants, while the third is th\\ne Wizard who acts as the channeling base for \\nthese Qlipothic forces. The Wizard should be \\nrobed in Black and White, acting as the \\nreceptor for this current of energy. The rite \\ninvolves an advanced form of assuming the \\nvampire Elemental, since the spirit is an un\\n-created spirit, with \\nno bonds to earth based \\nforces. \\nIt will be to your benefit in \\ndeveloping your own workable syst\\nem of sorcery, for there is \\nmuch to be gained in actual experience in the \\nworkings of evocations and vampire spirits. \\nThe Holy Guardian Angel or True Will should \\nalready be within und\\nerstanding, acting as \\na banishing force if such energies become \\ntoo powerful for the Wizard to contain. If the \\nsorcerers are unable to contain such an e\\nvoked demonic mass of energy, then each of \\ntheir lives can become filled with turmoil \\nand the area of working itself may become \\nhaunted. Sickness, weakness and ev\\nen death can occur. Such El\\nementals would be free to \\nmultiply in their existent natures since C\\nhoronzon is of no being, but multiplies freely, \\nand quite capable of mutating into any thing.  \\nA large circle should be made of flour and \\n/or salt in which the three shall stand. Two sm\\naller circles should be drawn also in flour \\nand/or salt as well, one in which the Wizard \\nshall stand and make the evocations and the \\ngrand invocation, by which he shall take th\\ne energy of the Qlipot\\nh, born of Choronzon. \\nWithin the other circle should \\nbe a triangle with the names of\\n Mi-ch-ael which is derived \\nfrom  Ceremonial Magick Trad\\nitions such as the Goetia of\\n Solomon the King. This is the \\nangel of protection by which the energies shall be bound. \\n\\nOutside of the triangle, still within the circ\\nle the magickian will inscribe the names of  \\nLilith, Choronzon and Kali. This \\ntriangle is to be within the circle however. The point of \\nthis is to ensure that the spirit force w\\nill not break forth. If it does by some chance or \\nmistake of the Wizard then the other two sorcer\\ners should seek to contain and banish it \\nfrom within their circle. Each\\n sorcerer should memorize or have near them the banishing \\nritesm which shall be used in case all goes \\nawry. An amount of the sorcerer\\'s blood shall \\nbe used, stored in a vial for this specifi\\nc rite. A sigil should also be constructed, \\nrepresenting the specific force which the \\n Wizard shall attempt to invoke from the \\nQlipoth.  Subsequent to the rite\\n itself this sigil may also be used to obtain knowledge via \\ndream. \\n\\n \\n Evocation of the Qlipothic Daemons   142 142 Perform a banishing rite and cast the circ\\nle widdershins as well. Now focus upon the \\ncircle and the triangle in which the spirits \\nshall be evoked. The blood within the vial \\nshould now be poured within the triangle. \\n \\nThe Evocation \\n \"Zazas, Zazas Natsatanda Zazas (3) \\n\\nI evoke thee, Shadows of Darkness, \\nfrom the World of Shells shall you manifest within this circle and \\n\\ntriangle \\nYe shall come in a controlled manner,  no act of aggression shall \\n\\nbe made unto any of us. By C\\nhoronzon, Guardian of the Abyss, \\nthy essence I evoke! \\nSend forth thy spawn, which haunts the worlds of shadows. \\nI hereby evoke thee from the tunnels\\n of the undead, the specter, \\nthe vampire, the succubus and \\nincubus, move and appear! \\nThe gates are open! For my charge is made. \\n\\nManifest within this plane of existence. \\nI offer my blood as a gift to enflesh this belief.\" \\n \\nYou may wish to repeat this evocation severa\\nl times to assure the mind has aligned with \\nthe callings, in order to activate the manifesta\\ntion.  Enochian keys, callings and the use of \\nthe other states of self induced trance shall prove helpful in the contact of such spirits. \\n The Binding  \\n\"Daemon and Spirits of the spaces of Non-Be\\ning, Vampires of the ghost spaces long \\nforgotten I have evoked thee here by my word\\n and will, and I charge that you must \\nremain within this circle. To not move fr\\nom it for any reason, save to be damned to \\nnothingness and the loss of all vital energy.\" \\n The Invocation  \"Oh mighty Rehctaw, that which exists between the shades of \\n\\ntime \\n\\nI do invoke thee within my opening self: arise within every \\n\\naspect of my being for we are as \\none. I shall traverse the spheres \\nof the Qlipoth and take on the fl\\nesh of the vampire and ghost So \\nit shall be!\" \\n \\nThe Wizard shall now enter a gnosis state in wh\\nich Rehctaw, the great watcher, has taken \\nthe reverse form. To assume this energy, intone as you destroy the sigil: \\n\\n \"There is knowledge in death through the eyes of Choronzon \\nThere is knowledge in blood from the tunnels of the hidden \\n  143 143 there is knowledge in death throug\\nh the eye of the Kia - the all \\nseeing\"  \\nEnter now carefully the circle in which your \\nblood has spilled. The blood that you gave is \\nof your being, therefore it is possible for the \\nsorcerer to absorb the energies contained \\ntherein. Breath deeply as you feel the Qlipot\\nhic forces enter, allow the death gnosis to \\novertake your mind, and feel the ecstasy of Thanat\\nos. It should be also noted that the two \\nassisting sorcerers should rec\\nite the proper banishing verses \\nwhile you are within, to keep \\nall escaping energies at bay. They should also \\nknow that you will be at the threshold of \\nthe Abyss and if not properly \\nin tune with the Will, Rehcta\\nw (4)  and the Holy Guardian \\nAngel then madness could overtake you at this very moment. They should be prepared to \\n\\nbanish all within the circle and to keep \\nyou, yourself at bay until properly banished and \\nthe mind returned. If these precautions fail there \\nis the possibility of \\ntrapping the self in \\nthe Qlipoth or succumbing to actual vampirism \\nby the evoked spirits. If such happens, all \\nmental stability will be lost and the sorcer\\ner reduced to a very slow and practically \\nworthless state of mind. Chances of rec\\novery would be very slight indeed.  The Banishing \\n \\nThe Wizard who absorbed the energies of th\\ne Qlipoth should now be the one performing \\nthe banishing within the actual triangle. The two additional sorcerers should move in full \\n\\neffect and focus of will towards the banish\\ning as well.  The Wizard should take several \\nhandfuls of salt and toss them \\nwithin the circle in which he stands, which action the two \\nassisting sorcerers should imitate as well. \\n \\n \"I now close the gates of your entr\\nance, the sacrifi\\nce of life force \\nwas made and your essence is \\nnow to depart.Go now with \\nswiftness and without causing ha\\nrm to any livi\\nng thing. I have overcome thee by force of will, to understand that which exists \\n\\nbeyond the barrier. Go forth now a\\nnd return to you plane, I cast \\nthee out unto the Qlipoth. Go and return. Depart! So it is done\" \\n Once this is complete, to ensure which you may wish to recite several times until the \\n\\nfeeling of tension has left, perform the trad\\nitional banishing rites to which you and yours \\nare accustomed.  Close the circle and banish\\n again. Dreams should co\\nme fluent and with \\nease, many of them shall be disturbing. I reca\\nll one specific one in\\n which I was in an \\nunderwater upright tunnel and va\\nmpire spirits were tearing gr\\nay corpses with white eyes, \\nthe essence leaking from their bodies was th\\nat of vampiric blood which the incubi and \\nsuccubi had stored. This was a \\nseparate incident from that \\nwhen I had dreamt of a single \\ndemon tearing corpses. The tunnel concepts were the same however. \\n\\nKeep a detailed journal of your visions an\\nd whatever you may \\ncome across in your \\ncreative or normal life occurrences. You will \\nalso notice your strength and ability on the \\nastral plane shall be increased. With this in\\ncreased ability you can contact or assume the \\nspirit of Black Eagle, for which there always\\n is a price. Those w\\nho have contacted this \\nElemental shall know of which I speak. The unspoken is here. Know thyself! \\n  144 144   The Witches Sabbat Doctrine and the Darkside Spheres of the Qlipoth \\n  \\nIn my personal workings with the Coven Male\\nficia  - which consiste\\nd of my wife, Soror \\nDavcina (Elda Isela Ford) and at one time tw\\no other individuals - our undertakings were \\nbased on the path workings which led me to \\nQlipothic Elementals. These entities could \\nand did provide knowledge and inspiration con\\ncerning the sorceries of which they were \\nborn. Many of these Elementals within the Ql\\nipoth already existed in a previous form \\nwithin the Abyss. The path workings only \\ngave them a knowable identity, by which we \\nmay associate with them. The Guardian of th\\ne Qlipoth and the Abyss is Choronzon, so it \\nis highly recommended that \\nthe sorcerer be strong and \\nsound of mind and body before \\nattempting to enter and pass through the Gates of the Witch Moon.
